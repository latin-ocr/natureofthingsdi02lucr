Ver. 526. Asstows th* mm'r-vious Erulum—J! It is
well known, that the Euxine, the Mediterranean,
aud many other seas flow perpetually in one uniform
current, :md exhiblt no εχει-53 or deficiency from a
ssux or rcflux of tide: ofthe two here enumerated,
the direction of their currents is diametrically oppo-
site: fur while the Mediterranean is for ever receiv-
ing an increase of waters, and flowing towards the
i·.terior; the Euxine is perpetually parting with its
waterf, and stou-irg externally into the Mediterra-
neau. Yet each pre-serves its balance; the Euxine
is never exhzmred, nor the Mediterranean ever exun-
dates. Differat causes have been advinced in order
to account for tha-sc extraordinary phaenomena. With
respect to the former, it has bec-2 generally supposed,
that its supply is obtained from the Danube, the
Don, the Νηρεῖ, and other considerable rivers, that
empty themselves into its bustum while the excuss
and superfluity of the litter is conceived to be carried
off by evaporation from “its surface. Neither osthese
explanatum, however, are altogether adequate or sa-
ti³factory z it is mor: probable that the one is fed by
spring-z, and the other cmptied by liswres, which lie
too low for the peracti-atron of man, and form a com-
municatiou with the Καὶ Seri, witon< current, contra-
riwise to that of the Mulitcrrmtenm is perpe-mally
flowing out. Or, psrhapffi the azcumulation of wa-
ttr iu the Medium-antam is carried oli* by an inferior
aud opposite current ; for that such antagonist cur·-
rcnts do occasionally, and probably at all timeS, exist
in the ocean ixsdf, ther-s cau be no doubt. Some
very ingenious experiments of count Rumsord seem,
indeed, to demonstrate that fluids os all kinds, when
heared to different temperatores in different parts of
their volume. mu2t11ec<·ssar³ly have such an opposition

cific levity. occupyiug the superior part, andthe colder
the part below ; a fact from which we may explain, to
illustr-frte the remark by a common incident,the greater
frigidity ol'the bottom of a boiliu„r tea kettle‚ though
inient-dizittly in contact with the tire, when measurcd

with the beat of its sides and summit. In likesnan-

ner in the ocean, the philanthropic writer, to whom
l have just referred, suspects there is an under cur—
rent of cold water flowing perpetually from the poles
towards the «μαῖον, even where the superior waters
flow obviously from the equator towards the poles:
nor is it possible, as he thinks, to account for the duf-
fereuce of temperatur-e which exists at different deptlxs
of the sea upon any other principle. On the 31st of
August, in the latitudo of 69, when the tempera-
ειη-ε of the atmosphere, and probably of the surface
of the sea. was 593 of Fahrenheit‘s thermometen·‚
lord Mulgrave found that the water at the depth of
4038 fret, sunk the thermometer to 3²· And at
the tmpic, where the difference of⁴seasons never pro-
duces a different-e in the temperature of the atmo-
sphere of more than five or six degi-ees, the varia-
tion between the beat of the water at the sursace of
the sea, and that at the depth of 3620 feet, has been

found to amount to no less than 31 degrees: the su· “ ’

perior temperature measuring 84, and that below
not more than 43. Essays Politian, &c. Vol. II.
Bc the real cause of these phaenomena‚ however, what
it may, Lucretius has selected a most beautiful and
apposite simile, by which, to illustrate the undeviat-
ing aud eternal course of the fluid ether which he
places in the superior regions of the atmosphere.
The translators have all, neoestheless, most unae· .
countably mistaken his meaning ς and have interpret·
ed the expression Ponti, or Ponto mare, sor it occurs
differently in diffireut editions, as generally refer-ring
to the sea at large. and not individually to the
Euxine, which it literally and peculiarly expresses.
In consequence of which, the appropriate beauty of
the simile is totally destroyed: for, whatever may be
the uniform regularity ofrthe tides of the sca, tbe ob-
ject of the poet js «to convince us, that the ethei-inl
emanation has no tides whatever. Even Marchetti
himself has fallen into this mistakev: ⁸

Impeto i fochi suoi move scorrendoe:
Che volgerei con ordine, ed avere
