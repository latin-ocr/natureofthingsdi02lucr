*DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. VI.

Quod super est, quali natura praedita constent

Fulmina, declarant ictu subinusta vaporis

Signa, notaeque, graveis halantes sulfuris auras.

220

Ignis enim sunt haec, non venti, signa, neque imbris,

Praeterea, saepe adcendunt quoque tecta domorum,

Et celeri flamma dominantur in aedibus ipsis.

Hunc tibi subtilem, cum primis ignibus, ignem

Constituit natura, minutis motibus atque

225

Corporibus3 quoi nihil omnino obsistere possit:

Transit euim validum fulmen per saepta domorum,

Greeks denominatcd ἔροντη, and
the Romans, tonitrus, fulgur, fulmen ς corresponding
among ourselves with the tem-is, thunder-peah thun-
der-flash,and thuuder-bolt. Our poet, having examined
and illustrated the two former branches of this extra-

ασΎρέἵπη, κξρᾱ-υνοζὶ

ordinary meteor, now proceeds to the consideration
of the third, the thunder-bolt, or immediate agent
of mischief, in the discharge of the munder-cloud.
He pur-sues the inquiry minutely ς examines into its
nature, its mode of productim, its velocsty, and in
what seasons of the year it is most frequent; con-
cluding the subject with some severe animadversions
upon the absurd superstition of those who ascribed
the creation of the tliunder-bolt to Jupiter3 as well
as of those who, like the Tuscans, deduced their
doubtful and idle auguries from this phaenomenon.
The discussion extends to ver. 434. of the Book be-
fore us-

And fust, with respect to its nature. Oui· philo-
sophie bard asscrts it to be a power originating from
a peculiar species of igneous corpuscles in a state of
combination‚ hereby forming agass or fluid, infinitely
more subtile and active than the light that streams
from the sun ς capable of transpiercing or breaking
every substance against which it impinges, and of
producing effects more powersul and astonishing

than any other known agent. These active and
impalpable atoms he supposes to be thrown forth,
partly from the substance of the earth, and partly
from that of the suu ; to consist of fire, and fire alone,
and to have no common property with elastic air, or
showers, or any other matters with which they may
accidentally be combined. He also asscrts, that in
their explosion they let loose a considerable portion
of sulphureous vapour, which is almost always in
some degree or another diffused through the atmo-
sphere.

Such, in few words, was the theory of Epicurus
upon this subject, and such is, consequently, the'
theory maintained in the text. And here it cannot
but be observable, however novel the science of

electricity, and especially its application to the me·
teor before us, that the Epicurean hypothesis bears
a much more striking resemblance to the system
which is founded upon this modern discovery, than
it does to that which immediately preceded it, and
which has scarcely yet given way in every quarter
to its triumph. 1 mean that which attributed
the corruscation or flash, to mere combustible va—

pours in the atmosphere, such as nitre‚ sulfur, and
bitumen. “

The Franklinian theory, like the Epicurean, sup-
