The astonishing length of this river, from its earliest
sources, which is calculated at upwards of three thou-

 

sand miles, together with the barbarism and stupidity
of the inhabitants on its banks, has rendered it, in all
ages, extremely difficult to be traced; and among
many geogmphers of Greece and Rome, as well as
among the greater number of their poets, the
discovery of its rise was believed an impossibi-
lity. Homer, therefore, boldly‚ and at once, calls
this celebrated stream “a river descending from
heaven,’' and in the Jewish scriptures it is stated

lib. iv. Plut. Placit. Phil. iv. ι. See also Strab-
lib. xvii. and Diod. Sic. lib. i. While, according to
Vossius, de AEtat. Mund. the more general opinion
was that the Nile derived its source eastwards, and

indeed from India itself: au opinion apparently ac-
credited by virgil :

Qaque pharetratae vicinia Persidis urget,
Et viridem AEgyptum nigra foecundat arena,
Et diversa ruens septem discurrit in oia

Usque coloratis amnis devexus ab Indis.
Gronc. iv. 290.

And where the stream from India’s swarthy sona,
Close on the verge of quiver'd Persia, runs,
Broods o’er green Egypt with dark wave of mud,
And pours, through many a mouth, its branching

flood. Sorusnr.

Our poet deviates from all these opinions ς he had

four months in search of its origin, but at
length relinquished his pursuit, as altogether fruit-
less. Alexander the Great and Ptolemy Philadel-
phus both re-attempted the discovery, by persons
well skilled in the geography of their day, who were
dispatched for this express pur-pose, but who, never-
theless‚ like Herodotus, travelled and inquired in
vain. Pomponius Mela declared, that it arose in the
Antipodes; Pliny, from a mountain of the Lower
Mauritania; Euthymenes, from the Atlantic ocean,
running, in consequence, through the very heart of
Africa, and ‹lividing it into two continents. Senec.

and selected what appeared most plausible. And
the accur-acy and distinct knowledge of the source
and course of the Nile, which he hence acquired,
when examined by the histories of later and success-
ful investigators‚ is truly astonishing. He does not,
indeed, with Bruce and Lobo, point out the exact
spot from which the earliest of its springs issues ς he
makes no mention of the mountains of the moon;
the lake Zambre, or Damhea, that spreads at their
basis, and collects the first waters of the Nile from se-
