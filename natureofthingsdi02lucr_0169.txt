THE NATURE OF THINGS. 1

The public sewer, or close appropriate vase,

pears from Columella, and others ς and it is reported
not only to possess a power of whitening woollen
stuffs‚ but of rendering them more supple. There
can be no doubt, moreover, that this struthiam of the
Greeks, and herba lanaria of the Latins‚ is the sapo-
naria, or soap-wort of modern botany, a plant cnu-
met‘ated by Liuncus in the class pentandria digynia ς
and by Tournefort in that of the (ychnis. Its root is
really detersive‚ and, like soap‚ removes stains from
cloths and stuffs. Of this plant, Dioscorides ob-
serves, Στρυθιον ’γνωριμον εστι ω sptem->turm χρωνται προς
καθαρῶν των spiam: ‘⁴ The struthium (soap-wort) is a
plant extremely common, and employed by the ful-
lers to clean their woollen goods.''

There ia no doubt, that the ancients were in pos-
session of a substance, which they denominated soapg
and it is equally unquestionable, that such soap was
formed in a manner not very different from our own.
This soap was, moreover, oftwo son-ts, sost and hard 3
but it does not appear that soap was ever employed
among the Greeks, nor very early among the Ro-
mans, as an article of trade by their fnllcrs or scou-
rers3 and, notwithstanding the similarity of manu—
factnre which seems to have prevailed, these soaps,
whether hard or soft, were rather ungnents for the
head than articles made use of for the purpose of
blanching. ‘⁸ Prodest est sap0,'' says Pliny, xxviiii.
12. “ Galliarum hoc inventum mutandis capillis.
Fit ex sebo et cinere, optimus fagino ct caprino.
Duobus modis, spissus ac liquidus. Uterque apud
Germanos majore in usu viris quam faeniinis.’' “ Soap
is also nsefnl, which is an invention of the Gauls for
decpening= the colonr of the hair. It is made of suet
and ashes; the best being from the suet of goats, and
[hc ashes of the bench-trec. There are two sorts of
soap, a solid and a liquid. Among the Germans,
the men employ both kinds more fret-ly than the wo-
men.’' Thnt it wan applied to the hair for the pur-
pose here specim-d, we lenrn from Martial, who, in
one ofhia epigranm, advises an old coquette, who ravcd
at her grey locks. to procnre xmp-halis from Ger-
αι’-1ης, to change their colonr. By degn-es, how-

ever, and probably first of all about the time of Ga-
len, these soaps began to be employed in the scouring
of woollen stuffs, as well as for the purpose of gene-
ral cleanliness: for, after having stated the different
repnte of the soaps of different cononica, he thus cx-
presses himself, as though he were relating a trnth
not generally known: ‘⁸ Verum omnis sapo potest
omnem sordem (le corpore abstergere, vel de pannis.”
‘¹ Eut every kind of soap is capable ol' removing futh,
of whatever description, whether from the body, or
from clothes.''

The sollers of Greece and Rome employed also ab·
sorbent earths, in :o··j::nction with lyes and detersive
plants. These were of various kinds, and from va-
rious countrics; the most esteemed was that deno-
minated Cimolian carth, from the isle of Cimolis,
which was one of the Cyclades, and where it wan
found in abundance. It was known, at least as
early as the time of Aristophanes, who mentions it in
his come-dy of The Frogs ε and it is still in use, ac-
cording to Bomare, among the inhabitants of the
Archipelago, ard applied to the same purpose uf
bleaching stuffs and linens. They also employed ar.-
other kind of absorbent carth, which was procured
in the island of Sardiniam which, however, was prin.
cipally made nse of in cleaniug white dresses, aud
did not equally succced when applied to coloured:
whence it is styled hy Nonius Marcellus inutilis wr-
sit-oloribm .

These earths or holcs were, for the most pari,
pressed into the stnlss or cloths by the hands or feet ς
hence the phrase in Nonius: “ Pedibus cretam dnm
compescis-,⁸¹ and these various operatione produce
an amazing change in their texture, by driving the
web of the woof more closely to that of the chain,
aad hence blending them more iiitimatcly together.
When cloths and serges first proceed from the hands
of the πεπυ, they are loose and confise, and in this
state would be bnt of little value or duration. But by
