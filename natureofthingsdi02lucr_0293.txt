Boon V, THE NATURE OF THINGS. 279

From each divided, and matur'd complete 45 5

From seeds appropriate3 whose wild discord erst,

Rear’d by their strange diversities of form,

With ruthless war so broke their proper paths

Their motions‚ inter-vals, conjunctions‚ weightS,

And repercussions‚ nought of genial act 460

Till now could follow, nor the seeds themselves,

E'en though conjoin’d, in mutual bond cohere.

Thus air, secreted, rose o'er labouring earth ;

Secreted, ocean flow’d3 and the pure fire,

Secreted too, tow’rds ether sprang sublime. 465
But first the seeds terrene, since pond'rous most,

And most perplext, in close embraces dung,

And tow'rds the centre conglobating sunk.

And, as the bond grew firmes, ampler forth

Press'd they the fluent essences that rear'd 470

Sun, moon, and stass, and main, and heaven’s high walls.

His brooding wings the spirit of God outspread ——qui primus maem'a mundi

And vital virtue infused, and vital war-nith Seminibus struxit minimis. i. 486,
