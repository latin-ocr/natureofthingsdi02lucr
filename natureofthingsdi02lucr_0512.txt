DE RERUM NATURA.

ι Lm. VI.

Quod magis, ad nubeis augenda3‚ multa videntur

Posse quoque e salso consurgere momine ponti:

Nam ratio consanguinea est humoribus omnis.

pure detached water, the salt from which it is extri-
cated would, by its own weight‚ be precipitated to-
wards the bottom of the sea, and hence the surface of
the sea-waters be less salt than their inferior column.
But by a variety of experiments, made by different
chemists, in different parts of the world, this does not
appear to be a fact. The sea, every where, in every cli-
mate, and to every depth, is found to be nearly equally
impregnated with saline matter; and it is determined,
on the most accurate trials, that this saline matter
is in the proportion of about 5¹31· of its whole weight.
The basis of common salt is natron or seda, and both
this, and the marine aeid, which combines with it,
appear to be simple and primordial substances—for
we know of no process of art or nature by which the
one or the other of them can be either formed or de-
composed. In the language of Mr. Kirwau, all
simple substances must have been coeval with the
creation, and have existed in the chaotic fluid, and
originally, at least, in an uncombined state, the com-
ponent parts of water alone excepted. The chaotic
ocean, therefore, impregnated with muriatic aeid,
dissolved‚ during the process of creation, as large a
portion of soda as was sufficient to saturare it :
and while flowing over the surfaces of the se-
condary mountains, or gradually retreating from the
summits of the primaeval, by filling immense cavities
it accidentally met with, it laid the foundation for
those rocks or beds of solid salt which have since
been explored in different parts of the globe-

For the waters thus left behind, by evaporation,
or occasionally by percolatiou through very mi-
nute pores‚ gave ample opportunity to the contained
salt to crystallize and harden into vast solid masses-
These, again, in process of time, have been occasion·
ally abraded and gradually washed away by rains, or
subterranean streams, into lakes and rivers; and
hence many lakes and rivers accidentally met with,
are also found impregnated with saline matters.

Ver. 490. For, as the blood, so fluids all transpire.]
The original text, corresponding to this verse, has

puzzled all the commentators. I follow the Bologq
nian manuscript of Pius, ver. 474.

Nam ratio cum sanguine adest humoribus omnis.

Literally‚ ‘⁶ for there exists one universal law with
fluids, as with the blood :'’ that is to say, that alt
other fluide, as well as the blood, throw off their
finer particles by a kind of insensible transpiration.

And the position is perfectly just : hence spirits be·
come weak, and a'c'rated waters vapid.

That this is the true meaning of our poet, is, 1
think, perfectly obvious, from what immediately oc-
curs in ver. 475 of the original:

Przeterea‚ fluviis ex omnibus, et simul ipsa

Surgere de terra nebulas, aestumque, videmus-‚3

Qae, velut halitus, hinc ita sursum expressa feruntur.
Thus, from each river, e'en from earth itself,
We trace th' ascending moinum, and the mist,

Lake vital breath borae upwards.
