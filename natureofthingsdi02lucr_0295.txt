THE NATURE OF THINGS. 281

For these of atoms lighter far consist,

Subtler, and more rotund than those of earth.

VVhence, from the pores terrene, with foremost haste

Rush’d the bright ether, tow'ring high, and swift

Streams of pure sire attracting as it flow'd.

Not differing wide from what full oft we view

When, at the dawn, the goldeli-tressetl sun

F lames o'er the meadows rich with rory genis,

And from the mountains, lakeS‚ ancl teeming glebe5‚

Draws many a vapour; which, when once aloft

' liquid state, we well know, that it must have been

at least heated to thirty-three degrees of Faliren-
heit’s thei-ineman, and possibly much higher: it
contained all the different genuine cums, 311 the -me-
tallic and semi-metallic substances now known, the
various simple saline substances, and the whole tribe
ol inflammables, solid and liquid, which are of a
simple nature, variously distributed, and probably in
a.proportion nearly the same as that they at present
bear to each other, forming, upon the whole, a
more complex menstruum than any that has since ex·
isted; and, consequently, cndued with proper-ties
very different from any with which we have been since
acquainted.

It is 3 fact, at present well established, that in
the act of crystallization‚ a very considerable degree
of beat is generated: the heat produced, therefore,
by the crystallization of such immense quantitiea of
ntony manses as necesszrily took place at this time,
arrd under these circumstances, must have been pro-
digions; and itu immediate consequence must have
been the uacent of the etherinl atmosphere thus ele·-
gantly ‹lt-neribcd by Lueretius: the astent, in effect,
of nn enornions and universal evaporation sweeping
over the sors-zce- os the heated fluid according to the

'uieqnnlity os its diffusion‚ and the different causes
that produced it.

Our geological hard, however, not only representa
to us the ascent of this unbounded vapom, bnt adds
that it was accompanied‚ ‘⁴ as it ssowed‚ with streame

examine how far such additional assertion agrees with
the modern theory of Mr. Whitehurst, as improved
and corrected by Mr. Kirwan. “ In consequence of
the beat and evaporation, as instanced above, the
quantity of the chaotic fluid,” observes this latter cos-
mologist, (Geological Essays, p. 18.) “ as also ita
specific gravity, was diminished. and thus the sub-
stances contained in it were still more disposed to

and copiously precipitated, and the aqueous par-
ticles interce-pred between them, being hereby de-
