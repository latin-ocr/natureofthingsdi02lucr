Throughout the rcmainder of this Book, the true
genius of poc-try is, perhaps, more powerfully and
triumphantly exhibittd than in any other poem that
was ever written. I am speaking, however, of the
original, being fully persuaded that the present ver-
sion has no pretensions to such a character. Lucre-
tius {tr-,s untur-:d upon one of the most uncouth and
repre-sing subja-ets to the Muses that can possibly be

lle sti-«wc, however. and he conquered. In language
the most captivaiing and nei-vous, yet never indeli-
mte, and with ideas the most precise and appropri-
are, he has given us the entire history of this tre-
menti« ns pv‘tiltnce: there is not, perhap5, a symp-

yet ‘lere is not

most scrupulous can be offended. Hippocrates and
Thucydides, who were eye-witnesses of its fearful
effects, and the latter of whom was a personal suf-
ferer beneath them, are the sources of his informa-

tion; and such is the accuracy with which he has
studied these celebrated writers, that the medical
student. may acquire, from the description before us,
an equal degree of entertainment and instruction.

In this bold but successful attempt, Lucretius has
been imitated by many poem, both of ancient and
modern times. Among his own countrymen‚ Virgil
and ovid have been the most happy in their efforts,
and in later ages Fracastorius‚ Lope de Robles‚ and
Armstrong.

The plague of Athens, here referred to, occurred
in the first year of the Peloponnesian war, and
emended, not only over the city of Athens, in
which it made its sii-st appearance, but over the
whole region of Attica, and in some few instances
even beyond it.
