Boon V. THE NATURE OF TIHNGS. 05,-

Baring tremendous‚ with far different tone

Threats, than when rous'd to madness more extreme.

Or when she beaks, and fills the world with roas.

Thus when her fearless whelps, too, she with tongue-

Lambent caresseS, and with antic paw, 1085

And tooth restrain'd‚ pretending still to bite,

Gambols‚ soft yelping tones of tendet love—

Far differ then those accents from the din

Urg’d clam’rous through the mansion when alone,

Or the shrill how] her trembling bosom heaves 1090

When, with slunk form, she waits th' impending bluw.
Neighs not the steed, too, different when, at large,

Mid the young mares, in life’s luxuriant prime,

Pierc’d by the goads of pinion'd love, he rave-5,—

And when his full-blown nostrils snort for war, ¹095

And every quiv'ring limb the tumult hails?
So, too, the feathery tribes of wing diverse,
Osprey, or hawk, or cliff-delighted gull
Gathering its vital nurture from the deep,
Far different sounds at different times protrudc ι lc ,

Thau when they strive, in hostile guise, sor prcy.
