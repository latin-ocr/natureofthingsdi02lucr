Est etiam quai re proprio cum lumine possit

volvier, et varias splendoris reddere formaS.

Corpus euim licet esse aliud, quod fertur, et una ·

Labitur, omnimodis obcursans obficiensque3

Nec potis est cerni, quia cassum lumine fertur.

Vorsarique potest, globus ut, si forte, pila'i,

Dimidia ex parte candenti lumine tinctus3

Vorsandoque globum varianteis edere formas.

Denique, eam partem, quaequomque est ignibus aucta,

Ad speciem vortit nobiS, oculosque patenteis:

Inde minutatim retro contorquet, et aufert,

Luciferam partem glomeraminis atque pila'i' ;

is generally conceived to have entertained this opi-
nion. None of his writings, however, at present, re-
main, that can fully authorize such a creed : although
detached passages of him, still preserved in the works
both of Plutarch and Diogenes Laertius, incontro-
vertibly prove that he regarded the moon as a body
luminous in herself. In the case of the planet Sa-

turn, we meet with a circular appeudage, which seems
cndowed with a power of collecting the rays os solar
light in a much ampler degree than the body of the
planet himself, and of diffusing them over his surface:
in the theory before us, a kind of converse substance
is supposed, an exterior orb orsatellite attendant upon
her, capable osabsorbing, instead of coucentrating and
reflecting the solat· lustre, and of course of remaining
perpetually opake and invisible. By a periodical
routine of evolutions, produced by such satellite,
iu the swut of the lunar orb, during her passage

round the earth, the different phases she exhibite arc
supposed to be created upon this theory.

It is a fact, incontrovertibly ascertained from obser-
vation of the lunar macuhe, that, with respect to our-
sclves, not more than one half the orb of the moon is
ever illumined. Whence we may fairly deduce these
two corollarieS, first, that the moon revolves around
her own axis ; and, secondly, that such revolution is
precisely commensurate with her revolution round the
earth ; and consequently requires a period of 29 days
12 hours 44 min. for its completion3 or, in other
words, that she has but one day and night in every
mouth. If this were not tire case, some part, at
least, os her opposite hemisphere, would occasionally
be presented to the inhabitants of the earth, which it
is not at any time : and therefore, to the present mo·
ment, we are totally ignorant of the superficial linea-
