THE NATURE OF THINGS.

423

And things rose punctual rul'd by punctual laws.

Now many a fort they rear’d, and into shares

1480

Sever'd the cultur'd earth3 the daring bark

O'er ocean now its light-wing'd canvas spread,

And state with state in social compact join’d:

While rising bards, the types of sound just trac'd‚

Stamp'd each exploit, and told to times unborn.

 

glyphics, which seem to imply a greater advance in ci-
vilization, and a more dextrous construction and use of
tools than is necessary in the adoption of what we may
naturally conceive to have constituted the earliest sym.
bolic elementa. To record any individual idea, be it
what it may, and among what tribe or nation it may,
the simplest mark that could be contrived, and most
easily cut or indented‚whether upon bark ‚ wood,brick‚
or stone, is a right line ε and it is probable, that this is
the type or memorandum which was first adopted by
the inventore os symbolic characters in every country.
Isthe idea be to be varied, it is easy to conjecture that
such inventors would vary the right line as to itu po·
sition; and hence, instead of perpendicular, it would
be rendered horizontal or oblique. Is a third, a
fourth, or a fifth idea be wanted, nothing appears so
simple or so natural as to use two, three, or four lines in-
stead of one; and tojoin them together in different di-
rections. Every such mark, in the first instance, must
have been a monogram, and indicated a distinct name
or word; but when long afterwards it was obser-ved,
that how much soever words might be duplicated, and
mightvaryin number,the soumls os which they are com-
posed are but few, and admit os bnt little variant-e 2-
the same system, it is not unnatural to conceive, was
applied toa developement of the ideas of sonnds,wliich
had before been applied to that ofother kinds officit-nn
and hence, ifthe idea of A, which, till now, had been
appropriated to an entire word, phrase, or, perhaps,
tnnsaction, were represented by Χ , that ol* 13 may
have been marked —; C, Ι 3 D, [Ἣ Ε» Aa 1⁷, νε
G, Γ; H, Η ; W, in the same manner as our own, or
thus ψ, οι· in any similar mode.

Such, then, appears to have been the origin of
all alphabetic symbols. In some¹ even os the oldest
standard, there is also an addition of a curve or circle,
into which the angles, by degrees, appear to have
been softened: and into such right lines, and the cc-
casional use of such circle or abraded angles, every
alphabet‚ with which wc are acquainted, resolves it-
sels. From the extreme difference in the name. num-
ber, figure, order, and power of some alphabeu,
compared with others, and especially of the Phani-
cian, and its derivatives, compared with the Sar-serit,
and allthose which have ramilied from it, as the Thi-
betian, Cashmiiian, Bengalese, Malabaric, Suc. it
appears almost impossible, indeed. that they should
have had one common origin. Nur is tbi, in any· rc-
spect necessary: what would indicate the nse uf a!-
phabetic characters to one peuplc might also indicate
it to otliers3 and there is, in effect, a ›irmlarity os -γς-
tem between all alphabtts. which seems :a infer a unu-
laritv, if not an unity, uf invention, and to burieni-
