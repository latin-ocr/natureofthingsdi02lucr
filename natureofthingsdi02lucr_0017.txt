'THE NATURE OF THINGS.

BOOK THE FOURTH.

Pmmm paths I tread untrod before.

Sweet are the springing founts with nectar new,

mame Book v. 856, 8573 and Book 111. 798-810,
with Book V. 134—146.

In the Note on Book 1. v. 377, 1 have offered a
few instances of the adoption of the ver-bal anaphora
in a variety os modern, as well as of ancient poems.
A still freer use has been made, in every tongue, of
the alliterative figure, or the literal anaplior23 so
free, indeed, among poetasters of our own dayS,
as'to have thrown an undue degree of obloquy on
the figure itaelf. Yet, that it is by no means al-
together unworthy os notice, wc may collect from
its casual adoption by Milton and Virgil: from the
former of whom, Ι have introduced an instance in
the above Note on Book I. v. 877 ; while, from the
latter, 1 shall content myself with referring the read-
·er to the following hemistich os the Georgics, iii. 9 ε

Victorque, virum volitare per ora.

It is said, that, among modern writers, the Ger-
mana have shown little or no predilection for this
playful figure ; and yet there are few, even of their
mont classical poeto, who will not surnish us with
instanccs of it. 1 now, accidentally, open the
Death of Abel, and in Book 1. p. 67, read in eurem
Jclsattm werd‘ ich wieder wandeln, wcmt ich, δίε.

The Persian pocta who, more than those of any

other nation, are attached to both the other ordeu-
οἱ the anaphora, afford, also, manifest proofs ofa
fondness sor alliteration. There is no gazel of Hafiz
better known than that which begins

{jumjso tamor-2„ ορ 0239)

In the tenth beit or distich we meet with the sol-
¹owing verse, which I shall transcribe in Roman cha-
racters, to render the force of the observation more
general:

Malli Kenani min musnedi mesr ani tori shood.

It is, perhaps, still less generally known, that the
sacred writers have, at times,indulged in the sameplay-
sulncss of ligure: and yet the verse in Isaiah, xxiv. 17,

ΠΞἸ Diffi-3] ’1Πῦ
Pachad u-pachath, pach,

in which the alliteration is obviously intended, as
well as various other instance-s ulrich might easily be
adduced, if necessary, and especially ch. lvii. 6. sus-
siciently proves, that it was as common :o the Hebrew
pocts as to those of other nations. Of all the sa-
cred bards. however, lsaiah appears to have been
most attached to the anaphora in all its different
branchcs; and the chapter before us, without goxng
