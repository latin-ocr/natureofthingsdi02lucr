DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. V.

Ut fama est, hominum multos quando obruit undis.

Inde, ubi vis, aliqu& ratione avorsa, recessit,

Ex infinito fuerat quaequomque coorta,

415

Constiterunt imbres, et flumina vim minuerunt.

Sed, quibus ille modis conjectus materiai

Fundarit terram, et coelum, pontique profunda3

Solis, lunai, cursus3 ex ordine ponam.

Nam certe neque consilio primordia rerum

420

Ordine se suo quaeque sagaci mente locarunt;

Nec, quos quaeque darent motus, pepigere profecto:

Sed, quia multa, modis multis, primordia rerum,

Ex infinito jam tempore percita plagis,

threw forth, at different times, from similar vol-
canos, portions of their own substance ; which,
by the common laws of projectileS‚ assumed an or-
bicular motion, and became the chaos of a rising
world. See Notes on Book 1. v. r 112. and Book 11.
v. 1 1 ¹73.

To admit either of thcse theories, however, is to
suppose the existence of a lar-ger portion of igneous
power than is warranted by nature: the greater part of
the mineralogic phaenomena we meet with appealing
rather to an universal aqueous solution, as their origin,
than an universal igneous fusion. There are few stones
that do not lose some part of their weight, and are al-
tered either in their lusu·e‚colour‚hardness, or permea-
bility to light, when heated. “ Could this happen,’² in-
quires Mr. Kirwan, Geolog. Essays‚ p. 455. “ ifthey
owed their origin to hcat ?’‘ Many silicinus crystals not
only lose their weight when exposed to a strong beat,
bnt absolutely decrepitate. Zcolytes lose from ς to 18
per cent.; turmaline, 15 ; and compound spar, as much
as 45. Many crystals again, as those ofquartz and cal-
careous spar‚are occasionally found both with and with-
out an intermediam prism, are terminatcd by a pointed

pyramid at both ends. But it is impossible that such
could be the result of previous fusion; for, in this
ease, they must necessarily have adhered, for their
support, to some basis in contact with them while in
fusion3 a circumstance which must inevitably have
altered their shape. Granularly foliated lime-stone,
again, is often traced seated on argellite, and even
intercepted between the laminae of urgellite: yet the
argellite‚ although one of the most susible of all stenes,
has not only discovered no marks of fusion, but even
of having been heated.

As to the existence of an aqueous deluge, and
that extending universally over the globe, long after
the creation of vegetables and animals, the detection
of shells on some of the highest mountains of Peru,
upwards of 14‚000 feet above the level of the sea 5
the bones of elephants and rhinoceri found in the
lowest parts of Sibe1i33 and shells known to belong
to shores under climates very distant from each other,
and yet mixt promiscuously together, are proofs of
such a phaenomenon, which all the. labours of Buffon,

Hutton, Baillie, and Playsair‚ can never invalidate or
render questionable.
