THE NATURE OF THINGS.

419

Run o’er the reeds with broad recumbent lip:

As, wakeful still, our revellers through night

- Lead on their defter dance to time precise3

Yet cull not costlier sweets,. with all their art,

1450

Than the rude offspring earth in woodlands bore.

Thus what first strikes us, while ourselves as vet

Know nought superior, every charm combines,

But when aught else of ampler boast succeeds

We slight the former, every wish transferr'd.

1455

Thus acorns soon disgusted3 the coarse couch
Of herbs and leaves was banish’d‚ and the hides
· Of savage beasts deem’d barb'rous‚ and uncouth.

Yet the vast envy such these first inspir'd

an extract from the Moallakat‚ by the Arabian poet
Lebid. The passage commences as follows ς and
the translation is by Sir W. Jones. The entire piece,
together with the accompanying poems, arc among

Pocock's MSS. at Oxford.

But ah ! thou know'st not in what youthsul play
Our nights‚ beguil'd with plcafflrc. swam away ;
Gay songs and cheerful tales ‹lecciv'd the time,

And circling goblets made a tumful chime ;

Sweet was the draught, and swcct the blooming
maid

Who touch'd hcr lyre bem-ath the fragrant shadc3

The damsels slumber'nh but we sipp'd again ς
