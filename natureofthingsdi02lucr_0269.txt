THE NATURE OF THINGS 2

Ο(
01

F resh bubbles distant at some fountain-head:

XVhence winds again the dulcet tide through paths

Its liquid feet have printed oft before.

285

To air now turn we, varying every hour

In every mode: for all that pours profuse

From things perpetual, th'e vast ocean joins

Of air sublime 3 which if to things again

Paid not, thus balancing the loss sustain'd,

⁴290

All into air would dissipate and die.

Hence, born from thing5‚ to things air still returns

Ceaseless‚ as prove their fluctuating forms.

Then‚ too, th' etherial sun, exhaustless fount

In Lucretius it runs thus: 277.

Ab'ris in magnum fertur mare.

This audaeious catachresis has been imitated repeat-
«ily, and in a variety of different languages. Thus,

. Klopetock :

Ich, ein kurzer gedanke des Unerschaffnen, ein
tropfen

In der schb'pftmgen metr. Msssms, v.

1, but a transient thought of the Supreme,
Α drop alone in being’s houndless sea.

But our own countrymen have been more attached
to it than any other. Thus Shakespeare :

the sea qs air.

 

So Cowper, addressing himself to the heavenly
constellations :

 

Tell mc ye shining hosts
That navigate a sea that knows no storms.
ΤΔεκ, v.
So, Gray, in a still ampler description :
Sailing with supreme dominion

Through the azurc ‹lcep affair. Puoc. of Pons.

Cowley has confessedly copied from our pott.
and as Lucretius has audaciously applied the term
ocean to the sky, he was determined to be even with
him, and has therefore, at the same time, and with a
converse figure, applied the term sly to the eccam.
The rhetorical artifice is herc, however, too casilv
discoverable, and the poet appears rather a hunter al:-
ter metaphors, than a minstrcl hurried auay involun-
tarily by the force of a sublime imagination. lt oc.

curs in his ode, entitled The Muse ε
