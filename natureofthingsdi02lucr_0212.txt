DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. IV.

Tum similes matrum materno semine fiunt:

Ut patribus patrio: sed, quos utriusque figurae

1205

Esse vides juxtim, miscenteis volta parentum,

Corpore de patrio ac materno sanguine crescunt,

Semina quom, Veneris stimulis excita per artus,

Obvia conflixit conspirans mutuus ardor ;¹

there, was a mere microscopic delusion: it was in
vain, that the impossibility was urged of the descent
osa pulpy and vesicular ovulum, through the almost
imperceptible canal of the Fallopian tube, with which,
in reality, it is never immediately connected ; it was
in vain to adduce the existence of an equal quantity os
maternal and paternal features in almost every family
in the world, the undeviatingintermixture of features
in mules, and other hybrid animals, and the casual
transfer of maternal impressions to the child when
suddenly frightened during the earlier periods of ges-
tation. The system of generation ab animalculo maris
was still triumphantly maintained, and the feeble ex-
ertions of the few, who had sense enough to opposcit,
were drowned in the multitudinous vociferation of
their opponents.

At last, arose the accurate and indefatigable Buf-
fon, and, undecoyed by opinion, as well as undismayed
by clamour, he resolved to deviate from the beaten
path of absurdity, to think for himself, and to pub-
lish his thoughts to the world.

And what do they at last amount to? 1f1 be not
much mistakem a resuscitation of the very theory of
EpicuruS, illustrated and explained from modern
science, and the experience of additional ages. All
animals and vegetables‚ according to the ingenious
theory of this admirable naturalia, contain an infinite
number of organic molccules in every part of their
frames: but in the sexual fluid, and the seed-vessels
of plants‚ they are more numerous than in any other
parts. These organic elements afford nutrition and
growth to the animal and vegetable system: and

when both become adult, the sur-plus is secrcted and

strained off for the formation of their respective seeds. -

The existence of vesicular ova detached at distinct
periods of time from the female ovarium is, upon this
hypothesis, a mere chimaera, and theii- passage through
the Fallopian tube into the uterus is declared to be
totally unfounded on any proof whatsoever‚ and a
mere assumption for the purpose of systematizing.
The ovaria are, in reality, testes, receiving, like those
of the male, the surplus of the organie molecules of
the body, and secreting thern for the purpose of ge-
neration. The seminal liquor thus secerned in the
male and female frames, are, in the act of coition,
protruded at the same time into the uterus, and be-
coming intimately blended together, produce, by a
kind of new fermentation, the first filaments of the
fetus, which grow and expand like the filaments‘ of
plants: for nature,it appears,commences all her opem-
tions by a similar kind of motion 3 and the fetus in its
state oi incipient existence, possesses nothing more
than this. To render such combination of seminal

ssuids productim, it is contended‚ that their quantities “

must be duly proportioned, their powers of aetion
definite, and their solidity, tenacity‚ or rarefaction,
symphoneous and accordant: and that the fetus is
either male or female, as the seminal fluid of the man
or woman abounds most with organic molecules, and
resembles the father or mother according to the dif-
ferent combinations of these clementS. Hist. Natu-
rellc, vol. iii.

This ingenious theory has since been strenuously
supported by Maupcrtuis, in his Venus Physiquc‚
