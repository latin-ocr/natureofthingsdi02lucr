Draw they: for when the feathery people once

770

Touch but their confine8‚ instant they forget

Their pinion’d oars, their plumy sails relax,

And down, plumb down, profuse, with fluent neck

Plunge they to earth, if earth their bottom form,

Or into poolS, if pool the mystic depth.

775

Such the dread gulf at (Συ-ΜΕ, belching high

Fumes of hot sulphur o’er the mountains round.

Such, too, at ATHENS‚ deep within her walls,

Steams from the tower, MINERVA’S temple near3

Where never raven, e'en when victims smoke

780

O’er the red altar, shows his jetty plumes.

With pinion‘d σαι-,ι through heaven’s vast vault he

Ver. 77 3. And down, plumb down, prqf'use, with
fluent neck] Nothing, perhaps, can equal the
beautiful imagery os the text, ver. 744.

mitable verse is thus referred to by virgil, but the
copy falls far short of the original:

Ad terramque fluit devexo pondere cervix.
Gtonc. iii. 524.

Downstows his neck with passive wcight to earth.

The whole of this passage appears to mc to have
been in the recollection of Milton, when describing
the deecent of Satan through the gulf that sepa-

necessity of rcturning to this description soon, l shall
now only quotz: tbe part that com-sponda to the verse
in question τ

Flutlering his p.·'nnons vain, plumb down he drops
Ten thousand sathoms deep.
