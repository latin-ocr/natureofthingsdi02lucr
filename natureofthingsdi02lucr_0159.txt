THE NATURE OF THINGS.

Sever’d, to join all powerless, or resume

Their wonted action; hence each varying sense,

970

The fount sensorial faiHng, must itself

. F ail too abrupt, the total body droop,

The limbs grow languid, listless hang the hands,

Totter the knees, and the faint eye-lids fall.

Thus food‚ alike, when through the frame it pours

975

Its stream salubriom, since the toiling air

It mocks in action, slumber too excites.

And heavier far his sleep whom diet full,

Or long fatigue o’erpow'r8‚ for ampler, then,

Th' intestine labour‚ and the soul flies off

980

Ampler external; while the remnant shrinks

Profounder part, and part through every limb

Strays more distracted‚ of all bond devoid.

Thus slumber issues3 and whate’er the thoughts

That chief subdue uS, the concerns that claim

which at present attach to it, has been just commu-

nicated in Note on v. 706 of this Book, admits ofa gcdy, noticed by Mr. XValker, in his “

plausible solution of this phaenomenon. The uninter-
rupted chain of vibrations and vibratiunelee, which
necessarily extends through the whole period os life,
as it is the source of all sensation and imagination,
must also be the source of dreams : and the different
associations of these vibrations and vibratiunclcs de-
termine the nature and subject of such dreams.
Oba. on Man, i. sect. 5. For the translator’s own

theory, see Note on ver. 936. of the present Book.
