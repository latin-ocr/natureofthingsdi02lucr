Ast alium subter, contra qui subvehat orbem3

Ut fluvios vorsare rotas, atque haustra, videmus„ ’

Est etiam quoque, utei possit coelum omne manere

Sive, quod inclusei rapidi sunt aetheris aestus,

Quaerentesque viam circumvorsantur, et ignes

Passim per coeli volvunt inmania templa ;

Ver. 537. Yet, {sunmov‘dthehravcnb orb wedecm]
On this sublime subject, our poet expresses himself
with much commendable modesty‚ and acknowledges
his doubts as to the different doctrines inculcated in
his own day. He has just given us the explanation
of the different phases of the heavens upon the hy.
pothesis* ψει] the §elfstial sphereguself moves uni-
formly round the earth, and carries the sun, moon,
star-s, and planeta, with it in its diurnal rotation,
Hc now proceeds to another hypothesiS, admitted
by several philosophers of his own aera, that the ce-
lestia} sphere itsclf is at rest, but ‘hattsshe-„hssfflnly
bodies contained within its circumference revolve,
in different and distinet orbits, from a force or
power with which each of them is individually
endowed. This, indeed, is a much nearer approach
to the medem theory of Copernicus, who main-
tained precise-ly the same, with the sole exception
that, instead of making the whole revolve round the
carth, he supposed the whole to revolve ronnd.,the
sun. Lucrttius not only adverts to such a conjec-
ture, bnt dclinzates, at the same time, the principie
.1pon which such rotatory motions might perhaps be
excited and persevend in: and nothing can be more

ingenious. Of all the substances that ascendet} from

the vast body of chaos, the atoms which composed
the etherial fluid were the most clastic and volatile ;
and as such, rose higher than all the rest in the scale
of creation: the luminaries of heaven, created from
atoms not perfectly equal to themselves in legerity,
occupying the second stratum in the celestial sphere.
In the formation of the two, he asserts, that a con-
siderable portion of atoms of clastic ether became
involved in their ascent towards their own proper
standard with those which produced the celestial
bodies, and were so extremely entangled as not to
be able to liberate themselves from confinement‚
when these luminous globes were completed. In
consequence of which, from their active and el'aatie
property,--their perpetual effert to escape at
every possible point—they created a rotatory mo-
tion similar to that produced in a watch from the
clasticity of its confined spring, or rather, perhaps,
to that produced by clastic vapour in our modern
stram-muchium ; and the invol'ving planet was hence
whirlcd round the centre os the common sphere.
What was the principle on which Pythagoras
founded his rotatory motion, we know not. I't
is probable that he had no more satisficd himself
on this subject than Copernicus on his revival
