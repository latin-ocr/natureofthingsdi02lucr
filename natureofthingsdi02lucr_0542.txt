DE RERUM NATURA.

- Lm. VI.

Conspicias hominis, fit ut omneis dicere caussas

Conveniat leti, dicatur ut illius una.

Nam neque eum ferro, nec frigore, vincere possis

Interiisse, neque a morbo, neque forte veneno ;

Verum aliquid, genere esse ex hoc, quod conscius dicet, 710

Scimus: item in multis hoc rebus dicere habemus.

Nilus in aestatem crescit, campisque redundat,

Unicus in terris, AEgypti totius amnis:

Is rigat [Egyptum medium per saepe calorem3

Aut, quia sunt aestate Aquilones ostia contra,

Anni tempore e0, qui Etesiae esse feruntur3

Et, contra fluvium flantes, remorantur3 et, undas

Mr. VVakefrelss as far holder, and more energetic
than the common version ε “ The river of all Egypt‚''
by way of cminencc, ‘⁶ which alone throughout all the
world overflows‚ &c.'’ The translation in general use is
thus offered us by Guernier: The Nile, the only river in
allEgypt, overflows, &c.'’ In corroboration of the ver-
sion now offered, the Hindus denominate the enormous
stream that rolls through the eastern provinces of their
country, Tun Ganoes ; the word Ganga in Hindus-
tanee meaningarivcr: and thus also,in tbeJewish scrip-
tures. the Nile itself is denominated Nachal Misraim,
“ the river of Egypt, or rhe great «τίφθ’ meaning Cairo.

still used in Persian and Arabic, to signify, generally, a
capital or metropolis: while Isaiah, ch. xxiii. 3. calls

The seed of the Nile,
The harvest of τΗε Rrvsa, was her revenue.

The Nile, however, is not, strictly speaking, the
only river in the world subject to a periodic exunda-
tion ; for the same fact occurs to all rivers which
have either their origin or channel within the tropics ;
since the same northern monsoon, the Etesian wind,of
which our poet here speaks, acts equally upon all of
them, and blowing fully in the mouth of their streams,
obstructs their passage to the ocean, and thus compels
them to overflow their banks for many miles round.
But, in consequence of the diminution, and, indeed, in-
significant size of the generality of those known to ex-
ist in the :era of our poet, in comparison with the Nile,
their periodic deluges were seldom or never advertet}
to by the natur-al historians of his own time.

The cause of this wonderful phaenomenon, as stated
in the text before us, is truly philosophie, and, for
the most part, has been progressively confirmed by
the observations of every subsequent age. The Ete-
sian mensuum—denominat& Etesian from the punc-
