differed with *respect to the former ; and with respect
to the latter, while Gallileo, Newton, and Buffon,
are stin contendssng in their writings that he is an im-
mense mass of luminous and culinary fite, Euler and
De Luc are denying him to bc light or fire in any
shape, and Herschell is maintaining him to be an
opake body altogether. In the midst of such differ-
ences of conjecture among the truly scientific, we
ought not to be surprised‚ therefore, that pretenders
to astronomy should have offered more extraordinary
conceptione stin. The mechanic, to whom 1 have
just adverted in the Note on ver. 529. of the present
Book, aa the contriver osa beautiful, and for the
most part, accurate orrery of the celestial sphere
upon the principles of the Ptolemaic system, igno-
rantly contended that the sun was very little lai-ger
than his apparent size, although he wisely sorbere to
decide as to his exact dimensione : while not more than
six or seven years ago another adventurer, os equal pe-
netration. attempted to demonstrate, that, so sar from
being a body ostire, or even an opake body, the uun is

neither more nor less than a large crystallinebodyofice.

In reality, notwithstanding there is some disagree-
ment in calculating the sun’s diameter between the
most able astronomers of modern times, this disagree-
ment has not varied much more than two degn-ees out
os two and thirty, from the time of Ptolemy himself.
to that of Ferguson,whose calculation was drawn from
the celebrated transit os Venus. The sun‘s diameter
is now generally admitted to measure about eight
hundred aud uiue-ty thousand English miles: in hi>
aggregate bulk he is supposed to be about live hun-
dred and thirtyniue times aud a half as lange as all
his own plancts put together. And from the unisorm
variation of his niaculae, or spots, he is ascertaiued to
have a revolution round his own axis in about twentv-
scven days and twclve hours. With regar-l tu [liis
rotary motion, however. it was calculated by Kepler to
be completed in twenty-four hours alme, while Otto

de Guerrie maintained, that it recurred every instant.
