But if the cloud be sere, with blaze abrupt

F lames it sonorous3 as, when blown by storms,

F ires the Ioose brand the laurel-crested hilis,

. 155

Decrepitating loud, for louder nought

In conflagration crackles than the tree

Sacred to PHOEssus on the DELPHIC mount.

While not unfrequent may the din resound

From ice or hail-clouds, by the whizzing wind
’ Lash’d till they fracture, and,

1'60
with clattering crash,

Falls the dread avalanche, down dash'd amain.

Ver. 156. sor Iouder nought
In conflagration crackles than the trec ]
The fable referred to is too trite for detail: but the
pcculiar crackling of the laurel tree in the act of con-
flagration, thus noticed by our poet, is corroborated,

 

 

as Lambinus has justly observed, by the following
passage in Pliny. Nat. Hist. xv. 40. Laurus
quidem manifesto abdicat ignes crepitu, et quadam de-
testatione. ‘⁴ The laurel shown obviously, by its

crackling, how much it detests the blazing fire.’'
To which Mr. Wakefield has added thia additional
testimony, from Ovid:

Et crepet in mediis laurus adusta focis.
¹ Fas-r. iv. 742.

And the sere laurel cmckles o’cr the hearth.
Almost, liter-ally, the language of Goldsmith ι

The cricket chirrups on the hearth,
The crackling saggotflies.

 

Ver. 162. ] The term is
now sufficiently naturalized for poetic use; and i³
well known to imply the sudden sall of those irn-
mense mountains of ice, which, in Switzcrlnnd, and

—vvalanchn

other precipitous countries, arc occasionally dctachcd
from their parent and impending mass, and, by their
abrupt dement, not unsrcquently ovem-licina and bury

a whole cottage and its inhabitants. The litem!
rendering os the text, which is as follows,

in artum

Concretei, montes nimborum ct grandine mixta,

 

is to this purpose, “ τηουηῑειίῐίς of clouds intermixcd
with hail-stenes, concreted into one compact sub·
stance.'’ The radica! verb avale, to 'hasten down, or
vale-wards, has, indeed, been long known (ο Engli=h
bards of the first reputation‚ and was not uiifrcquently

employed by them in earlier seras. Thus Spenser :

By that th' exaltcd Plioebus 'gan avale
His weary wahl, and now thc frosty night
Har mautle black through htav'n 'gan overhale.

The mountains of ice here specisud by our poet
to exist occasionally in the superior regions of the
atmosphcrc, are ilius referred ιο by Milton iu te iiiii
surpriziugly similar:

As when two pulai- winda, blowing adverae

Upon the Cmnian sea. together driu-e

Moumains of icc, that stop th' imagin'tl way

Beyond l‘cxsora carmani. Pax. Liar, x. 289.

That hail-nones arc tliux frrqucntly conglomerata]
in their own clouds. into large iim-..scs υί icc, can admit
of no doubt : these. in ihc nuda of {inundet-narnis,
arc often precipit-ueni to the carth, aud arc rigauled,

by the multitude, as tl ιιιιιι {cr-balli or ‹hunda-[mlii.
