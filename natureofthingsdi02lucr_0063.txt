This species of drawing, and, probably, of paint-
ing, strictly so called, must have been of very early
origin indeed. Embroidery and tapestry, in which

colours were introduced, we know to have been of ”

high antiquity cven among the Jews and Babylo-
nians; but both these arta presuppose the existence
of oudines, or linear drawings,-—for the artist ne-
cessarily worked from a pattern. The history of
Pandion, king οἵ Athens, and of his daughter Phi-
lomela, who informed Progne of her misfortunes by
describing them on tapestry, may, perhaps, be fa-
buleus. Be this, however, as it may, we know that
this fablc is of very remote origin ; and, as is related
by Apollodorus, was, probably, the production of
one of the Cyclic poets, concerning whom the reader
will find an account in Note on Book V. v. 339. of
the present version. According to this admirable
mythologist‚ Philomela did not indeed paint her his-
tory, but embroidered it in characters on a veil. Yet,
at the period when this fabi: was invented, we can
scarcely conceive, that embroidery was confincd to
the exhibition of characters alone ; it was unqucstion-
ably employed, and with more freedom. in the art of
tracing and designing. In the time of Homer, how.
ever, we have undoubted proof of the application of
tapestry to the dignity of historicnl subjects. Iris,
in the third book of the iliad, finds Helen occupied
in representing on tnpcfitry the evils which the Greeks
:ind 'l‘rojnns had suffered on her account, in their
battles. Such an undertaking, cren suppming it
were executa-d in cmnrnco, or uim a single colour,
evinces a considerable perfectioni of the art ahc was
practising. But the Trojans arc stated to hare bun

also acquainted with the mode of intermixing dif-
ferent colours in their tapestries. When Andro-
mache learned the death of Hector, she was at work
in a retii-ed part of her palace, and representing, in
tapeatry, flowcrs of a variety of tinctures.

To the merc outline or silhouette the Corinthian
or Sicyonian artist, according to Pliny, added strokes
to its interior,—j.:m tunc spargentes lr'neas intus ‚· a
style which is yet retained whenever the quill or the
crayon is employed3 and'some admirable drawings‚ in
which are still preserved at Rome as the productiori
of Polydore of Caravagio‚ a celebrated pupil of Ra-
ph'ael ; the mode of executing which is denominata!
by the Italians al sgraefitto. Our historian then ad-
vances to a second epoch, regarding the mere outline,
and thc outline with internal strokcs as one and the
same, although I cannot but agree with M. Levcsqne‚
in his very ingenious cssay on this subject, (Mem.
dc l'Instit. Nat. Lit. et B. Ares, I.) that the for-
mer mnfit, for a long period, have preceded the lnt-
ter. This second cpoch of Pliny compriscs the nse
of a single colour alone, and its style was, in consc-
qucncc, denominntcd by thc Greeks, Monocn1-.›1na-
ton, :ind is still retained, in modern rimer, under the
appellarim os camna-0. For this improvement the
