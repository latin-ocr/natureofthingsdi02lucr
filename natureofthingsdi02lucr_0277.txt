VVhence ere the THEBAN war, and fate of Tpemr

Have earlier bards no earlier actions sung ?

AEneid. has, with great plausibility‚ conceived that
almost all the Roman, as well as the Greek poets,
were intimately acquainted with it, and that many
of them hence derived the chief part of their mate-
rials. If, then, this Book, which contained all the
archives of antiquity, and which was certainly known
to Lucretius, had enumerated any event of consi-
derable moment, and which was regarded as sober
history by his contemporaries, prior to the Theban
and the Trojan wars,—we certainly should not have
found our poet making the inquiry:

Whence ere the Theban war, and fate of Troy
Have earlier bards no earlier actions sung?

And, in reality‚ the little which we do know of this
work induces me to suppose, that the latter was the
very extent of the date assigned to it, as to actual
history, and that, in particularising these two events,
our poet had his eye directed, at the moment, to
this very collection. It is uncertain, indeed, whe-
ther Homer-'s name were enumerated among the
Cyclic poets; Casaubon gives us great reason to sup-
pose it was; yet Athenaeus takes no notice of him,
while he expressly mentions the name of Aretinus,
who is conceived to have been contemporary with
Homer, and who certainly wrote a poem upon the
very subject selected by the quenum„ Περσις, ⁴⁵ The
Fau of Troy.’' Contemporary also with Aretinus
was Lcsches, who, according to Phanias, as cited
by Clemens of Alexandria, contendcd for superiority
of merit with the author of the Ιλιου nepo-g, and bore
away the prize. The poeni of Lesches was entitled
Ιλιας Minya, “The Littlc Iliad :” which Poem is
falsely attributed to Homer himself by thc Homeric
biographer who signs himself Herodotus. This
‘⁸ Little 1liad’' of Lesches comprized, unqnestion-
ably, a part of the Epic Cycle. There was also in-
cluded in it, according to Athenaeus, a Poem en-
titled‚ ‘⁸ Thc Thebaid,¹' the author of which is now

unknown, but whom Casaubon has confounded with
Antimachus. (In Athen. p. 480.) And.we have
no fragment in any writer which intimates the ex·

340

istence of any other poem founded upon any prior
historical fact. The Trojan and the The-ban wars
were, therefore, in all probability, the earliest events
of history referred to in this book ofa11cie1-t legende ;
and it is hence highly pmbable, that our poet had
it in 1113 immediate recollection when writing the pas-
sage before us. In effect, we have no fragment in
any writer which intimates the existence of a poem
of any kind founded upon historic facts antecedent
to the existence of Troy and Thebes.

The author, or rather editor of the Epic Cic-lc,
if posterior, as in all probability he was, to the age
of Homer, was, at least, anterior to that of So-
phocles ;⁴ for Athenaeus expres-:aly informs us that the
Greek tragedian drew the subject of several ofhis
dramas from the Cyclic poets. Casanbnn, but with
little authority to support him, attributes a part of
this collection to Onomacritus, who flemis-hed during-
the age of the Pisistratidae, of which family, the lat
was banished from Athens in the second year of tle
sixty-seventh olympiad, being five hundred and ten
years before the Christian aera. M. Heyne very rcu-
sonably conceives that the entire compilation una
not the work of one editor alone, but of a variety ς
and that some later scholar arranged its dzffmni
parts into one unifonn work. Procius, in liis Chii*-
tomachia, a book lonnr lost to the world, gave a ca-
talogue of the names and the coniux-ies of all :lw
poets whose productioris coi.sii1nt2‹l ilie Epw C)- lt.
