ditional force from the entrance of externa] winds and
waters through the medium os its extreme hollows,

combined force of so many tremendous agents arc al-
together inconceimble, and perfectly sufficient to ac-
count for au the phaenomena ot* volcanic eruptions.

Hippocrates.

Sublim'd with mineral fury, aid the winds,

And leave a singed bottom, all involv'd

In stench and smoke. PAR. Losr, i..
