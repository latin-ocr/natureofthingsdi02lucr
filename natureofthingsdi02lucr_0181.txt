Turn from such subjects to pursuits unlike.
Nor are the joys of love from those shut out

Who brutal lust avoid3 the· pure of heart

Far surer pleasures, and of nobler kind,
Reap than the wretch of lewd and low desire&

Drives his keen teeth‚ and every kiss indent53

By latent stimulus the part to wound,

Where'er its seat, that frenzies thus his soul.

But V ENUs softly sooths the wrongs endur’d,
