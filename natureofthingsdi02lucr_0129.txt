Boox lv, THE NATURE OF THINGS. 117

Α creed e'en urg'd by nature, since, profound,

Through the still frame then slumbers every sense, 780
Void of all power to mark the true from false 3

Nor rouses the dull memory to clear

The fancied scene, or prove the forms we see

Erewhile fell victims to oblivious fate.—

Nor wond'rous deem it that such forms should move, 785
Or wave their hands, as dreams full oft disclose,
Or trip their frolic feet to num’rous time.
For the light image stays not, but Hows on
In streams successive3 hence when this to that
Yields of diverse arrangement, from the change, 790
Rapid as thought, the first seems moving sole.
So vast their powers of action ; such the stores
Of things create, the countless phantoms such
Flung through each moment's least capacious point.
Yet many a question themes like these excite, 79 5
Deep thought demanding ere illumin’d clear.
Vlhence springs it that the mind, with instant haste,

Thinks on whate'er the wayward will resolves ?
