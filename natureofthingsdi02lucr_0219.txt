Boon lv„ THE NATURE OF THINGS. 205

Kindle the blazing altar, wearying heaven

Vainly‚ to fill the void, reluctant womb.

For blank sterility from seeds ascends 1 320
Too gross, or too attenuate 3 if the last,

Ne'er to the regions that generic spread

Cleave they, rejected instant as propell'd.

But if too gross the genial atoms‚ dull

Move they, and spiritless, or never urg’d 1305
With force sufficient, or of pow'r devoid

The puny ducts to pierce, or, pierc'd, to blencl

,Harmonious with the vital fiuid found.

For love harmonious‚ whence increase alone

Can spring, oft differs largely‘3 easier far 1310
Some filling some, and others easier fill’d

And gravid made by others: whence, at times,

Those‚ many a Hymen who have erst essay'd

V ainly‚ at length th’ appropriate stores acquire,

And feel the lovely load their wombs enrich. 1 3 15
While he, perchance, whose prior bans forbade

All the fond hope of offspriug, happier now

A mate has found of more concordant powers,

And boasts a race to prop his crumbling age.
