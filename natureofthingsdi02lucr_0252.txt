purified essence of these immortal spirita, and imbibc
some portion of their tranquillity and happiness.
Epicurus was much accustomed to these solitary se-
clusrbns, and attributed no small portion of the ha-

man vision. they. nevertheless, when they are wit-
nesses of thy good det-ds, suffer themselves to be
both heard and perceived, and assist thee in thy

The belief of Empedocles does not appear to have
been very different from that of Epicurus¹ if we may

bitual calmness he enjoyed to their influenee. There judgc from the following fragment of his Poem, ss On

is a considerable degree of resemblance between these
mental abstractions of the Epicureans, and those of
the modern Qrakers: and each, in consequence of
such habitual retirement from the world, such quiet-
ism and banishment from their own passions, and
meditation on superior and beatified spirits, have
been remarkable for the undeviating serenity of their
tempers: a serenity that, even upon their return
to active life, is seldom materially disturbed by
any of the chances or changes that occur around
them. See fai-ther on this subject Note on Book VI.
v. 78.

Mr. Wakefield, upon the passage now under con-
sideration, has cited a paragraph from Nazarius so
highly pertinent and illustr-atim, that I cannot re-
strain myself from inserting it. Paneg. Const-
Ang. xiv. 2. “ Et quamvis caelestia sub oculos homi-
num venire non soleant, quod crassam et caligantem
aciem simplex illa et inconcreta substantia nature te-
nuis eludat ; illi tamen auxiliatores tui, adspici audi-
rique patiente& ubi meritum tuum testificati sunt,
mortalis visus contagium refugerunt.” ‘⁶ And al-
though the immortals are not accustomed to be de-
scried by the eyes of men, since the simple and un-
compounded substance of their attenuate nature must
necessarily elude an orgari so dull and gross3 yet,
notwithstanding they thus avoid the contact of hu-

the Nature of Things, and thc Four Elements:

the mind’s pure spiril—] This
forcible and energetic expression is not unfrequently
employed by Lucretius, and is already commented
upon in Note on Book 1v. v. 774. It gives us the
full idea of the mind concentrated within itself; or
converging all its lines of radiation towards 'one
focus, to be able more accurately to determine on
an object presented to its notice. In the sacred
Scriptures wc occasionally meet with the very same
phraseology.
