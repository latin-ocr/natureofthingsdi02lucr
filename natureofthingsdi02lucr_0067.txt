THE NATURE OF THINGS.

Of the pure plate relinquish'd‚ thence no more

F lies the ficet semblance ; fate’s eternal laws

Deciding ceaseless that the film propell’d

Must bear each variance of the parcnt form.

Such are the slcights of mirrors.

Mark we next,

How hates the eye-bal] every gaudy glare3

How darkens in the sun when pour’d direct3

Such his vast power.

Yet here that power alike

345

Flows from a stream of effigies through heaven

Impetuous flung, the tender pupil oft

VVounding severely3 and, at times, so fierce

Rushes the radiant tide, the total orb

Burns with the fiery particlcs contain’d.

The jaundic'd thus, not unaccordant‚ see

All clad in yellow, many a yellow seed

Or flocks, or herds, or human face divine.—

So much the rather thou, celestial Light !

Irmdiate ς there plant eyes, all mist from thence

Purge and disperse, that Ι may sec and tell

Of things invisible to mortal sight.

dedication, :md fnum which the priests, appointed to
minister on the solemn occasion, were obliged to rc-

treat, “ a night of brighlness,’'— παι-[ιι der erscheinun-

Ver. 351. The jaumlic'd thus, not unat-cordam, see
All clad inyellow‚ ] The explanation is
extremely apposite, and, upon the Epicurean sys-

of objecta to persons afflicted with the jaundice.
The first is that, from the prcdominant secretion of
the seeds or particles of yellow communientcd to th:

is perpetually ejectiQr must necessarily be co—
