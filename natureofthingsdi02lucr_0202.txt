DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. IV.

Unguit amaracin0‚ et foribus miser oscula figit.

Quem si, jam inmissum, veniens obfenderit aura

Una modo, caussas abeundi quaerat honestas;

Et meditata diu cadat, alte sumpta, querela:

Stultiissfflque ibi se damnet, tribuisse quod illi

Plus videat, quam mortali concedere par est.

Nec Veneres nostras hoc fallit3 quo magis ipsae

Omnia summo opere hos vitae postscenia celant,

Quos retinere volunt, adscriptosque esse in amore 3

original, ver. 1 ¹79 :

 

vitae postscenia celant.

 

In the different editions this verse has been vari-
ously written, and much perplexity has, in conse-
quence, occurred to the expositors. Lambinus has
the creditos having restored the true and genuine

Latin notes, has obviously a metaphorical allusion
to the theatro. Postscenium is a place behind the scenes,
where many things are transacted not intended to be

beheld by the spectators. By this expression, there-

ladies of pleasure are engaged at home when alone,
and which they are studious to conceal from their
lovers. “ The ancient theatre‚’' as Ruaeus has ob-
ser-ved, “ was a semicircular building, appropriated to
the exhibition of plays, the name being derived from
Θεαομαι, to behold. It was divided into the following
parts: 1. The porticus, scala, sedilia ,- the rows of
sedilia, or scats, were called cunei, because they were
formed like wedges, growing narrower as they came
nearer the centre of the theatre ; and these were al}
disposed about its circumference. 2. The orchestra,
so called from ορχεισθαι, to dancez. it was the inner
part, οι· centre of the theare, and the lowest of all,
and hollow, whence tbe whole open space of the
theatre was called cavea. Here sat the senators, and

here were the dancers and music. 3. The proscenium,
which was a place drawn from one horu of the

theatro: to the other, between the orchestra, and the
