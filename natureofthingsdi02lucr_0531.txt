Boox VI. THE NATURE OF THINGS. 517

O’er earth and ocean, every fountain add 635
And still the vast, accumulated mass,

Weigh'd with the deep, would scatce a drop exceed.

KVhence nought stupendous that it ne'er augments,

Next‚ daily, much the solat heat exhales.

For as the sun, o'er humid garments pours 640
His bearns profuse, with instant haste they drym

But broad and> spacious spreads the liquid 1nain3

Yet large th' amount its total surface yields.

Then, too, the flick'ring winds with ceaseless wing 64 5
&Vinnow an ample portion. Such their power
Ost, in a night, the swampiest paths they cleanse,
Brush off the wer, and harden all the mire.

And earlier have we taught that every cloud

Imbibes‚ luxurious, the redundant dew 6 50

Rais'd from the face of ocea113 and o'er carth,
