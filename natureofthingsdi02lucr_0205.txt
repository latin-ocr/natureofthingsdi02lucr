THE NATURE OF THINGS. 191

W hence those of soul ingenuous frankly own,

Frequent‚ those faults which none can all escape.

Yet not for ever do the softer sex

1245

Feign joys they feel not, as with close embrace‚

Frame prest to frasne, their paramours they clasp,

And print theIr humid kisses on their lips.

Oft from their hearts engage they, urg’d amain

By mutual hopes to run the race of love.

1250

Thus nature prompts ; by mutual hopes alone,

By bliss assur’d‚ birds, beasts, and grazing herds,

The task essay ; nor would the female else

E'er bear the burden of the vig’rous male3

By mutual joys propell'd. Hast thou not seen,

1255

Hence tempted, how in mutual bonds they strive

Work'd oft to madness ? how the race canine

Stain with their vagrant loves the public street&

Diversely dragg'mg, and the chain obscene

Da columbatim mitia basia
Sugis amentis partem animi.

Thus energetically interpreted by the translator of
Secundus ε

Let a wan-mer crimson strcak

The velvet of thy downy chcck:
Let thy lips that breathe peu-sume,
Det-per purple now assume ;

Give me now one humid kin.

Now repent the melting bliss ;

Soft, my Love Ε-ιη) Angcl‚ stay ἔ
Sost ! you suck my brcath away.

Ver. 1252. By His: assat-¹127, birds, bases, audgm-
zing het-ds,
‘Thr [ask [πα-γ ;] Thus Milton :
But if the sense of touch, whereby mankind
Is propagated, seem such dcar dclight
Beyond another, think the same vouchsafed
To cattle and ench beast ς which would not bc
To them made common and divulget), if aught
The rein enjoycd were ποι-ὼγ to subdue
The soul of man, or passion iu him move.
Pu. Losr, viii. 578⁷
