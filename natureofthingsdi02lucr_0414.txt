DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. V.

Tum penetrabat eos, posse haec, liquefacta vapore,

Quam lubet in formam et faciem decurrere rerum3

Et prorsum quam vis in acuta ac tenuia posse

Mucronum duci fastigia procudendo,

Ut sibi tela parent; sylvasque et caedere possint,

1265

Materiemque dolare, levare ac radere tigna,

Et terebrare etiam, ac pertundere, perque forare.

Nec minus argento facere haec auroque parabant,

Quam validi primum violentis viribus aeris ε

Nequidquam ; quoniam cedebat victa potestas,

1270

Nec poterant pariter durum subferre laborem.

Nam fuit in pretio magis aeS, aurumque jacebat

Propter inutilitatem, heberi mucrone retusum ;

Nunc jacet aes, aurum in summum subcessit honorem.

correct. The metals primarily employed by man

must have been found pure, or in their native state.

 

] Our poet is here truly

Copper, in its native smte, however, is less frequently
to be met with than either gold or silver3 conse-
quendy, in the first ages of the world, it must have
possesseda superior value to these, as well on ac-
count of its greater scarcity, as its greater validity.
In modern times, these, and all other metale, are
principally obtained from their ores or calces: and
the very reason why native gold and silver are more
common than any other metals‚ in their native jbrm,
is their impromptitude to amalgamate with any other
substance, or to be dissolved in any kind of fluid:
consequently‚ while there is a larger proportion of
gold and silver to be traced in their native state than
of anfi: other metal, there is an infinitely les· propor-

tion in the form of ores or crystallizations. Iron,
on the contrary, which intermixes, and becomes
sulphurated or oxygenated with other substances,
more easily than any other metal, is scarcely ever to
be found, excepting in its ore or pyrite state: native
iron is on this account less frequent than either native
gold, native suver, or native copper3 and is expressly
so stated to be by our poet, ver. ¹3 19.

We may hence derive some idea of the proficiency of
the ancients in the science of mineralogy. Of the
extent to which it was practically pursued, we may
form some judgment from an asser-tion of Polybius,
that not less than fhrty thousand workmen were em-
ployed in the mines near Carthage ς while Athenaeus
relates, more generally, that the miners in Attica were
so numerous, as that at one time they rose in rebel-
lion, and made themselves masters of the promontory

of Sunium. It was probably on some such account ‘
that a law was passed, as we leam from Pliny, re- j
