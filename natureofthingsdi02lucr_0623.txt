THE NATURE 01⁴· THINGS.

Dropp'd of the public conduit33 in the stream

VVallowing uuwezzried, and its dulcet draught

Deep-drinking till they bursted.
Threw o'er the high-ways, and the streets they tr0d‚

Stagg'ring‚ some

Their languid limbs3 already half-extimet,

Horrid with fetor, stiff with blotches foul,

With rags obscene scarce cover'd3 o’er the bones

Skiu only, nought but skin ; and drown'd alike

Among the Hebrew poets the same imagery is
common, and, at all times, employed with great
boldness and success. Thus, Job, xix. ιο :

’nsvnp2a⁹awnnirnvn
ow ww: nioben-ini

My bone clenvcth to my skin and my flesh ;
Mzrely have 1 escaped with the film of my teeth.

The last line of this couplet has not hitherto been
properly understood by the commentators, and has
hence been supposed obscure and difficult. The
common reading, ‘¹ and 1 have escaped with the
:kin of my teeth‚'’ though adopted in most modern
languages, is not easily intelligible. Schultens as-
εει-ιε, that by the :kin of the teeth is meant the ἕψω,-
but, incapable osexplaining the phrase appropriately,
hc conveniently resolves it into a proverbial idiom,
while Reiske assei-ts, without evidence, that the
term ἾἸὩᾎ, “ of my skin,’¹ is an interpolation,
and, as such, ought ro bc rejected. In my concep-
tion, adds he, the second part of the period isan
elegant itt-ration to which Job often recurS. His
wurds are au follow: ‘⁴ ’χρ Πωῇῃῃκη excidit
dens meus. Vulgata lectio hunc sensum fundit.
Cum cute mea, et cum earne mea cohaeret os meum·
Sic. Arabe-z, „1530 dicunt et simpliciter, bk]

mea, '5792 ‘1192 est elegans alliteratio, quam
jobus persaepe affectat.‘’ On the rendering 1 have

that there is no necessity, either sor rejecting ni.)
part of the passage, or generalizing it into a natiorial
adage. The Hebrew Ἰ, in our own standard xcr-
sion rendered and, is, in the present case, a particle
of limitation—merel25 solely ; and the term 52⁰2.
(besr) meansfilm as distinctly as skin: the Arabi-
ans use the same word, 2⁴⁹¹! and 325¹? in both senses,
to the present day. The phrase “film, orsur of the
teeth,'’ after a long and febrile disease‚ requires no
explanati0n3 and the patriarch, in bold but impres—
sive language, intimata, that so much was he wasted
or emaciated by his malady‚ that this was the whole
that remained of him. The passage has been imitated
both by David and Jeremiah. Thus the formet· :

Smitten like the wither-al grass is my hem-t
Since I have forgotten to eat my food ;
From the loudness of my lamentationi my bones ,

cleu-ve to my sliu. Ps. eii. 4.

The latter, as follows ι

Blacker is their visage than a coal 3—they are not
known in the streets :

Their skin ele-well) to their bones5 it is become
witheredas a stick. Lam. iv. S

Thus elegantly rendered into Spanish by Count
Bernardino de Rcbolledo :

De las nativas rocas arrancados,
(Qic las tiniehlas mas se escurccicron ;
Sus mii-imas calles no los conosciemn.
Qic su piel a los hut-sos se ha pcgado ε
Qal lenio sc han scendo.
