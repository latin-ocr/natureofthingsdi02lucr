Boon IV. THE NATURE OF THINGS. 121

So vast their powers of action3 such the stores
Of things create. And hence when this to that
Yields of diverse arrangement, from the change
The first alone seems moving to the sight. 820
Thon, too, so fine their texture, that the mind,
Save when profound it pries‚ their sep'rate forms
Can ne'er distinguish3 hence, unnotic'd, waste
Those the dull mind prepares not to survey.
For thus prepares it ceaseless, and expects 8 2 5
The coming vision, hence survey’d alone.
E'en see'st thou not the pupil, when it first
Kcns some fine object, all its orb contracts,
And strains ere yet the figure full disclose ?
Thus, too, in scenes more obvious, if thy sou] 830
Thou bend not to the vision, it remains
As though from thee far distant and disjoin'd.
What wonder each light image, then, should die
Vim-less, the mind ne'er rouses to survey.
Then things minute, too, large full oft wc decrn 83 ς
W ide wand’ring from the fact, and self—decciv'd.
And oft a form the present phantom wear*

Unlike th’ anterior, woman now, and now
