THE NATURE OF THINGS.

That nought stupendous seems it they, at length,

Sho'uld gain those stations, those connexions gain,

Whence sprang th’ Entire of all thingS, and subsists.

E'en though the rise of things Ι ne’er could prove,

205

Yet dare I, from the heaven's defective frame,

And many a scene alike perverse, affirm ·

No power divine this mass material rear'd

With ills so gross, so palpable to sight.

F irst‚ all beneath th’ etherial cope’s wide whirl

210

What hills rapacious rise! what woods beset

With tribes ferocious! what uncultur'd rocks !

*How stretch the stagnant lakes, of life devoid‚

And the vast main that severs shore from shore!

Clamat—auctorem natura, opus undique summum

Arguit artificem : mens, abdita torpore, cernit

Nunc opus, artificem, mox corpore libera, cernet.
Anu-Luca. ix. 635.

All nature speaks its author ; the vast work
Prot-es the vast workman. In the body hid,
The work, the workmau now the mind pcrceiws,
But soon, releas'd, {nore clearly.

Ver. 210. Fiat, ιιΙΙ benmth th’ elberial cope’s «υἱώ
whirl] ln the original, there is a beauty
and sublimity of description which has never been
surpasszd by any poet, ver. 201.
Principio, quantum coeli tegit inpetus ingens,
Inde avidam partem montes, sylvaeque serarum,
Pasa-edere. &tu
The passage. however, has been unisormly mista-
ken in all the translations l have met with. The in-
terpretation os Cret-ch is that of the rest ε

For first those tracts of air what creatur-es fin ἒ
Why beasts in cveiy grove, and shady hill ε’

Lucretius makes no mention of creatures filling the
air: his obvious meaning is ‘⁶ as widely as the mighty
whirl of the heavens spreads its cover-ing, so widely
are beasts ofprey found in woods and mountains‚ &c.’'

Ver. 2 ι 1. that hills ruptulous] As though dis-
contented with their own portion os the earth, they
wished to seize on all that surrounded thern. The
metaphor is trnly dan‘ng and sublime.

The entire passage is thus imitated by Young:
A part how small of the terraqueous globe
Is tenanted by man ! the rest a waste,
Rocks, desarts, frozcn scas, and buming sands !
Wild haunts osmonstcrsffloisons, stings,and death.
Such is cmh's melancholy τηειρ ! but, far
More aad! this earth is a truc map of man.
So bounded are its hanghty lord's delights
To woe’s wide empire ; where εἰει-μ troubles toss.
Luud sui-tows howl, invcnom’d panium binc,
Rav'nous calamina our vitais seim,
And tln'catniug {ute wide-opens to devonr.
