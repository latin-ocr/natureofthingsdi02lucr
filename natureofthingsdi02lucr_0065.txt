THE NATURE OF THINGS.

Thus solve the problem that the convex plate,

Like a twin mirror, twice the scene reflects

Ere yet it touch the vision3 or, perchance,
Th' approaching image turns completely round,

A turn the flexile splendour proves precise——

Then the light image, too, with us affects

There was also another mode of employing wax
in ship-painting, which ms obviously invented for
the sake of duration, but which is equally lost to us.
The little with which we are acquaintcd of these
different methods is preserved by Pliny in the fol-
lowing passage, xi. 41 z Encausto pingendi duo fuisse
antiquitus genera constat, certi ct in chore, cestro, id est,
vet-uculo ; donec claues pingi caepere. Hoc tertium ad—
ussit, resolutis igni ceris penicillo 11temli; que pictura iu
navibus nec sole, uec sale, ‘ventisque corrumpitur. ‘⁴ There
were formerly two modes of painting in encaustic,
with wax, and on ivory, by the nse of a cestrum, or
graver, till, at length, ships began to be painted.
A third mode was then invented, which consisted
in employing a pencil brnsh with wax dissolved over
a ἧιϊς which produced a pointing for vessels that
was never injured by the sun, the sea-water, or the
The passage is by no means perspicnoum
and Pliny, who was no paintcr himself, does not
appear to have been in the sceret in cithcr case.

two fonner, a ecstrnm or pointed graver was em—
ploycd3 and, in the latter, a pentil-brush. M. Lc-

vesque observes, therefore, as has been observed also
by M. Schtffer, (Graphice, par. 16.) that the
painting upon ivory was less properly a painting
than an engraving‚ the point of the graver being
heated in the fire tn a red heat——that the lines were
osone colour alone, and this a black or a tawny.
Ῑ know not, however, what reason these writers
have for limiting the encaustic painting on ivory to
any individual colour: those in wax, most assurcdly,
comprehended every kind and combination of co·
lour3 for, in thc ode of Anacreon above referred
to, hc makes express mention of black, white, blne,
and red: and as the instrument employed in both
these modes was the same, as they were both effected
by a similar process os five, and as Pliny does not in-
form us that there was any differcnce in the appli-
catinn of the inanimem, we may as nadily suppose
that the encaustic on ivory admitted the introduction
of different colom-s, as the encaustic in wax. M. lc
Compte dc Caylus imagincd he had recovered the
Greci-an mode of encaustic ship-painting a few years
ago: but his method, though ingenious, is rather a
new invention than a rcvival of that spoken of by
Pliny: in the languagc of M. Lex-esque. it is an
