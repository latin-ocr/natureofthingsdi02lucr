DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. V.

Quom tamen hiis posset sine rebus vita manere 3

Ut fama est, aliquas etiam nunc vivere genteis:

At bene non poterat sine puro pectore vivi.

Quo magis hic merito nobis Deus esse Videtur:

Ex quo nunc etiam, per magnas didita genteiS‚

Dulcia permulcent animos soIatia vitae.

Herculis antistare autem si facta putabis,

Vos, ο clarissima mundi
Lumina, labentem coelo quae ducitis annum,
Liber, et alma Ceres ; vestro si munere tellus
Chaoniam pingui glandem mutavit arista,
Poculaqne inventis Acheloia miscuit uvis.

——Ye lights of heaven ? whose sovereign sway
Leads on the year around th’ ethereal way ς
Bacchus and Ceres ! if, beneath your reign,

Earth chang'd Chaonian mast for golden grain,
And the new grape's uncultur’d vintage gave
To mix its sweets withAcheloiis'wave. Sora env.

This version of Mr. Sotheby 1 cannot, therefore,
but regard as correct ; though, if I recollect aright,
both Dr. VVarton and the Abbc' de Lille, in notes on
their respective translations of the passage, think dif-
ferently, and give a dissimilar interpretation. I refe-r
the render, however, upon this subject, to the Note
on Book IV. 1214, where the history and mytho-
logy of these divinitics are detailed at some length.

Ver. 18.

‘This moment know not ;

 

and, through many a clime,

 

] The observation
is astrue now as it was in the timc of our poet: and
notwithstanding the increascd intercourse of different
nations, frcm the augmentation of commerce and
trade, we may yet say, with Faber, that scarcely the
sixth part of mankind know what wheat is, or, per-
hapS‚ assty other kind of corn. The growth of corn
iniplies an advance from a state of barbarism to some
degree of civil society: but the sixth part of man-

md :rc ntt yet civilizcd to a degree sufficient for

this purpose. The American Indians are sor the
most part hunters to the present moment, and subsist
upon the prey they obtain: among the Kamschat-
kadales, and other barbarians of the North, the food
commonly employed is oil, fishes, and saw-dust3 and
among all the newly discovered islands of the Pacific
Ocean, yams, fishes, or the fruit of the bread-tree,
the kangaroo, and not unstequendy, perhaps, human
sacrifices. It is useless to pursue the sketch fai-ther.

 

Ver. ¹9· but ⁰s virtue void,

And purity qs beart, manill cem thrive.] We
often hear, even in the present day, lectures of
morality preached by those who do not practise
them. But the disciples of Epicurus, contemporary
with Lucretius, and more particularly our ethic bard
himself, have a right, from the uniform tenour of
their lives, to moralize with the severity here exhibit-
ed. The gratification of the corpor-eal senses was
not their object, but tranquillity of heart, and an im-
provement of the mind. The pleasures which such
propose to us are not dependent upon lime or acci-
dent·‚ they are dui-able as life itsclf. Those who,
like Ceres or Bacchus, have contributed to the ra-
tional enjoyments of the body, have meritorionsly
exerted themselves ; bnt sickness, senility‚ and a thou-
sand other changes and chanccs of life, must occa-
sionally incapacitate us for such pleasures. Over
persons addicted to such pursuits alone, the real
Epicurean may therefore justly exult, and infinitely
more still over those whose whole existence is blood-
