Nenu queunt rapidei contra constare leones,

Nimirum, quia sunt gallorum in corpore quaedam

Semina, quae, quom sunt oculos inmissa leonum,

Pupillas interfodiunt, acremque dolorem

Praebent, ut nequeant contra durare feroces3

Quom tamen haec nostras acies nihil laedere possint:

Aut quia non penetrant, aut quod penetrantibus illis

Exitus ex oculis liber datur, in remorando

Laedere ne possint ex ull& lumina parte.

Nunc age, quae moveant animum res, adcipe3 et unde,

Quae veniunt, veniant in mentem, percipe paucis.

least, was the common persnasion in the age of Lu-

much less philosophically‚ attributes the terror of the
lion to the colour of the cock’s comb. Nat. Hist.

referred tn, be true, or not, it would be idle to
doubt of a similar power possessed by several species
-of the serpent genus, and a power which is probably
lodged in the pupil. There are many accounts of
this extraordinary fascination of the ratde-snake over

birds and squirrels related, and sufficiently attested
in the Philosophical Transactions: and these have
lately been confirmed by posterior travellers through
America‚ of unblemishcd reputation and veracity.
According to such historiam, the first moment a bird
or a squirrel catches, from the branches of the tree
on which it is perched, the glance of the ratde-snake
below, it is instantly convulsed with terror, rendered
modonless, and incapable of saving itself by flight.
As its tei-ror inci-cases, it gradually approaches its
fascinating tyram, and often enters, of its own accord,
into the serpent’s mouth, which he keeps open for
this purpose. But the mule-snake is not the only
serpent possest of this wonderful faculty : the com-
mon field viper, according to the testimony of the
viper—catchers themselves, at particular seasons of
the year, possesses a similar power, and obtains ita
