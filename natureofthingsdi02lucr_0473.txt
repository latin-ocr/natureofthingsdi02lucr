Boon VI. THE NATURE OF THINGS.

Rear'd from one cause, from one concussion rear’d.
Or haply hence the winged lustre springs
Trembling amid the tempest; that when air,

Pent in the hollow of a cloud, ferments,

That hollow broad’ning‚ as already sung,

And close its sides condensing, the pent air

Heats from its moti0113 as, from motion, heats

All sight surveys; work’d oft to flame, and oft

Melted‚ as melt the missile balls, at timeS,

Of lead shot rapid. Heated thus, at length,

T h’ expanded air bursts sudden from its tomb,

Scatt’ring long trails of corruscating fire.

Then rolls the dread explosion, after heard,

Since sound than light far tardier meets the sense.

Yet scenes like these in clouds alone exist

Of utmost depth, whirl'd mass o'er mass immense.
Nor such conceive exist not, but that sole

Breadth they possess, of substance ever void.

For mark what clouds of mountain-buli< the winds
