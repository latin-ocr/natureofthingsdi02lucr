Corpoream quoque enim vocem constare fatendum est ,

Et sonitum3 quoniam possunt inpellere sensus.

Propterea radit vox fauces saepe ; facitque

Asperiora foras gradiens arteria clamor.

Quippe, per angustum, turb&⁴ majore coorta,

Ire foras ubi coeperunt primordia vocum

Scilicet, expletis quoque janua redditur oris

Rauca viis ; et iter laedit qua vox it in auras.

Haud igitur dubium, quin voces, verbaque, constent

Corporeis e principiis, ut laedere possint.

Nec te fallit item, quid corporis auferat, et quid

excited, and faithfully imparts to the‘mind the sensa-
tion of mund, in the same manner that the eye im-
parts the sensation of light. The proportion of
sound communicated depende upon the density of
the medium z hydrogen, or inflammable air, convcy-
ing it much less perceptibly than atmospheric ; and
azote, or fixed air, much more so. But, on the den-
sity of air depends its elasticity: consequently,
where there· is no elast'ic medium, there cau bc no
propagation of sound.

For this reason, water,

which possesse-s but a small portion of clasticity,
scarcely communicates it in any degree. Yet, even
this theory has of late been objected to by ΜΓ.
Gough, a philosopher, whose observations are well
worth attention: although he does not appear to
have substituted the Epicurean or any other system
in its stead. See Memoirs of the Literary and Phi-
Iosophical Society at Manchestcr, vol. v. part ii.
