DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. lv.

Inter enirn saepit coetus natura, viasque3

Ergo sensus abit, mutatis motibus, alte.

Et, quoniam non est, quasi quod subfulciat artus, ⁴

Debile fit corpus, languescuntque omnia membra3

Brachia, palpebraeque‚ cadunt3 poplitesque cubanti

950

Saepe tama submittuntur, viresque resolvunt.

Deinde, cibum sequitur somnus, quia, quae facit a‘e'r,

Haec eadem cibus, in venas dum diditur omneis,

Ecficit: et multo sopor ille gravissumus exstat,

Quem satur, aut lassus, capias; quia plurima tum se

Corpora conturbant, magno contusa labore.

Fit ratione eadem conjectus parte animai·

Altior, atque foras ejectus largior ejus3

Et divisior inter se, ac distractior, intus.

Et, quo quisque fere studio defunctus adhaeret3

dreams, which are accounted for upon the common
principle of universal effluvia‚ and the power of these
volatile and tenuous pellicles to pervade the pores of
the corporeal frame‚ and impinge upon the mind it-

See Note on ver. 41. of this Book.

The doctrine of Aristotle, who, conjointly with
Epicurus, admitted of the existence (uf phantoms or
emanations‚ is not vei-y dissimilar: for dream, he ex-
pressly tells us, are only those phantasms, emanations,
or apparitions of things arising from impressions pro-
duced by external obj-„ets ou the brain, and remain-

ing aster such objects are removed. Not widely dif-
ferent from which was the doctrine of Hobbs and of
Wolfe: the latter of whom asserts, that all dreams
originate from external impression upon the organs
of sense, and are continued by a succession of phan-
tasms in the mind3 but that no phantasm, and of
course no dream, can possibly take place, without
some such previous sensation. Psychol. Empir.

If, for phantasms, we read ideas, we have the
conjoint theory of Malbranche, Des Cartes, and
Locke.
