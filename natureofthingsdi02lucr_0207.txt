Toils they would ne'er essay if unassur'd

and salutary, has at length acquired so luckless an
issue. Although he exclaims with full voice,

Fly, wretches, fly !—o'er yonder coast the trains
Of treacherous Sirens spread their rapturous painS,
Their dulcet deaths‚ their joys that stab the heart ς
Haste, cut your cables instant, and depart.-—

“ Althongh he has proved, in a variety of express
arguments, that debauchery is a most dreadful pest
to mankind; and that the snares of libidinous love,
and the faithless females who attempt to spread
them, ought rather to be avoided than a mad dog or
a viper : although he has demonstrated that property,
character, health of body and mind, are alike meltcd
away in the abominable pursuit ; yet here, where he
chiefly excels. even in this very place, these rigid
woithies vociferate—and long do they often protract
their vociferation,—Ah ! fly these indecencies, these
obscene precepts„ these ribaldries‚ these verseS, too
infamous to be noticed, these love-intrigues, Sec.
But, worthy sii-s, if indeed ye deserve such appella-
tion, here are no ribaldrics, no verses too infamous
to be noticed : and if any thing of the kind
should appear, it is the fault of the reader, and
not of the poet. This, at least, 1 may venture to af-
firm, that if the precepts Lucretius has here written be
to be accountcd indecent and libidinous, they fall sar
short of the obscenity :ind indecency that may bc
found in a certain book which no one dares censure
without endangering his reputation. But, in truth,
what was the object Lucretius had in view ? &Vas it
to encourage debauchcry, and to acquire a pccnniary
profit by this most detestable of all trnffics? Such
may have been the object of particular poet> in many
agen they may have profited by their nnclean la-
bours; and some perhaps do so still: bnt iutegrity
of lise, gmvity of manners, and the moral and whole-
some precepts which are scattered occasionally
throughout almost every page of the present work,
should chace every suspicion os this kind far dietant
from Lucretius. ln short, :irc yon anxious to know
the advice he gives ? Rvad theu ας follows:

Yet fly such phantom, from the (00110111.κί-

Abstain, libidinons ι to worthier themes-

Turn‚ turn thy sou!,· behold! the pure of hcm-t

Far surer pleasures, and of nobler kind

Reap‚ than the wretch oflewd and low desii-es,

who, in the moment of enjoyment's sels.

Still fluctuater. with a thousand fears subdu'd ;

Nor aught of antidote exists‚ so deep

Pines he, perplext, bene-ath the latent ill.

Then too his form consumes ς the toils of lo-:e

&vaste au his vigonr, and his days roll on

In vilest bondage. Amply though endow‘d,

His wealth dccays„ his debts with speed augment,

The post of duty never fills he more,

And all his sickening reputation dies.

Unsound Is every hope; some bitter still

Wells forth perpetual from his scunt os bliss,

And poisons every flowret. Keen remorse

Goads him perchancc sor dissipated time,

And months on months destroy'd ; or from the fa'r

Haply some phrase of doubtful import dai-ts,

Thau, like a living coal‚ his heart corrodes.

Hence, by the muse forewarned, with studious
heed

Shun thou the toils that wait ; sor easier far

Those toils to shun, than when thy foot once slides

To break th' intangling meshes and be free.

‘² Rcader! dost thou call those, who thus write,
the abettors of debauchery, or its most eloquent and
inveterate opponents ?''

In illustr-ming our author's descriptions, I have had
frequent occasions to notice the strong and striking
similarity that prex-ails between his own image-5 and
manner, and those of the writer of the Sacrcd Pro-
verbs. Solomon, like Lucretius, however, does not
continue either his delineation or his mmai in ene
connected 5‹·rics; they are purpose-ly brokm an] in-
