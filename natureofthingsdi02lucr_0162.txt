Non homines solum, sed vero animalia cuncta.

The rhoughts indulg'ass ] So generally does

the imagination follow the common train of our ha-
bitual, views and passions in slcep, that Smellie, in his
Philomphy of Natural Histoi-y, gravely advises us to
study the important.science of sels-knowledge from a
regular history of our dreaxns, committed to writing

 

every morning as soon as we aas-ake 3 and has given us
a prospectus of this kind of nocturnal table with re-
gard to his own slurnbers, for four or five days.
“ This method,’¹ says he, “ of discovering our real
characters, it may be alleged, is more uncertain, and
attendcd with greater difficulty than self-cxamina-
tion. But we should reflect that, during deep, the
mind is more ingeluinus, less inclined to palliate its
real motions, less influenced by public opinion,
and in general more open and candid than when
the sensas are awakess’ Philosophy of Natural His-
tory, vol. ii. 3.

This, with respect to all persons who dream in
their sleep, is highly probable; but more especially
with respect to somnambulisrs‚ cr others who are sub-
ject to an occasional wakefulness of one or two or-
gum, while the rest are plunged into a profound tor-
pidity. I have already ohserved, in the. Note on
v. 936. of the pre-sent 1³›o‹›k, that where the vigilant
sense is that of hearing alone, the slceper will often,
'without any conssiousness of the fact, enter into
conversation with any one who may address him:
his cars are open to the voice, but he cannot discri-
minate thc person, and in almost every instance
mistakes him. Completely thrown off his guard,
he generally uzstmsoms all his hem, and disclo-
πε to a dextere—1< zuidrcsser tho most ivr-portant se-

cret-s in which he has been engaged. See uie French·
Encyclopedei‚ Nottambule.

Animab, that sleep throughout the whole of the
winter-seasom have certainly a less vivid imagination
during their torpidity, and probably have no imagina-
tion or dream at all. In general, there is scarcely any
action of any kind‚either ofsoul or body, perceptible to
the minutest scrutiny. Dormice and squirrels are as fat
when they awake in the spring as when they bedome
torpid in the autumn3 but they lose neither perspi-
ration nor ekcrement. Yet bats are known to part

with the latter, during their winter-sleep; and the
hedge·hog· and the Alpine marmot, however sat when
they first enter their subterranean retreats, become
extremely emaciated on recovering from their tor·
pidity.

In general, these hybernal slumbens, whether of
birds, reptiles, or insects‚ are produced by arr aug-
mented coldness in the atmosphere upon animale
whose natural temperature seldom, when awake, ex-
ceeds five or six degrces of the freezinghpoinn and is
almost always, therefore, excepting in winter, consi-
derably below the temperatur-e of the atmosphere it-
self. The garden squiri-el, the sat squirrel, sciurus
glis os LinnCms, the dormouse and the bat, do not
much vary in the internal heat of their bodies at any
time ; it seldom exceeds 37 or 38 degrees of Faren-
heit, which last number is buz six degrees above 'the
sreezing point, even when the atmosphere is heated
to 70: and it generally sinks to about 34 in their
state of torpidity. When the coldness of the atmo-
sphere surpasses that of their own bodies, or in so'me
cases only equale it, they become torpid, seek some
sedndcd asylum, and *rohsnai-ily resignssthemsclvee
