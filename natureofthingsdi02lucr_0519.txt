THE NATU‘RE OF 'rfllNGs 505

But fierce the torrent falls when fierce at once

Clouds press o'er clouds, and winds with winds comensi. 5 3 5

And much the rain persist5‚ and long its stay

When countless crowd th’ irriguous seeds above,

‘Profuse the louring vapours, and the clouds

Roll multitudinous, of bound devoid,

And all the smoking earth the wet rehales. 540

· And when the sun, amid the rushing shower,

Gleams from a point all adverse to the storm‚

The crystal moisture, as it falls, his rays

Ceaseless reflects„ and rears -the gaudy bow.

Thus all, through heaven, that forms or floats sublime, 545

neatise De Radiis visus et Lucis, publislied by
Bartolus in 1611.

To the above intelligent and modest description
of Lucretius, ,Ι shall now take the liberty of adding
Akenside's account of the same meteor, founded
upon the doctrine of ren-action, and-imbucd with
much of the spirit of the modern theory. It is mule
diffuse5 but, I think, not more poeticnl :

Nor ever yet
The melting rain-bow’s vernal—tinctur’d lines
To me have alione so pkasing, as when first
The hand of scicnce pointed out the path
In which the sun-bcmns, gleaming from the west,
Fau on tlte watery cloud, whose darksomc veil
Involves the orient ; and tliat trickling show'r
l’icrcing through every crystallinc convcx
Of clustering dew·drops to their fliglit oppos’d,
Recoil at length where concnve au behind
‘Th’ internal sui-face of caeli glaasy oib
Repels their forward passage into air ς

what thence direct they neck tlie radiant gual
