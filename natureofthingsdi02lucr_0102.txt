DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. lv,

Dissiluit semel, in multas, exorta quasi ignis

Saepe solet scintilla suos sc spargere in igneis:

610

Ergo replentur loca vocibus, abdita retro

Omnia quae circum fuerunt, sonituque cientur.

At simulacra viis de rectis omnia tendunt,

Ut sunt missa semel: quapropter cernere nemo

Saepta supra potis est, at voces adcipcre extra.

615

Et tamen ipsa quoque haec, dum transit clusa viarum,

Vox obtunditur, atque aureis confusa penetrat3

Et sonitum potius, quam verba, audire videmur.

Hoc, qui sentimus sucum, lingua atque palatum

Plusculum habent in se rationi8‚ plus opera‘i.

Ver. 626.
Things pent above,

whence none can see

‘In all the common impressions, and in every tran-
slation hitherto exhibited, sor septa we meet with se,
which would make the sense thus ε

an explanation that by no means so satisfactorily il·
lustrat-es our author's argument, which he thus more
sully exhibits in Book VI. 984.

Through the stone-wau voice winds its sinuous
way.

be reminded of a passage in the Orestes of Euripides¹

which seems, almost in vain, to have exercised the in·
genuity of all his expositors :

‘13' ατρεμοιιαν ὦς ὖττοροῷον

Still are my words, as utter’d in a room
Retir'd and private.
Ver. 630. To rAsrtspt-occedwe: ] The phae-

 

nomena, as Ι have before observed, of all the senses arc
accounted for, by the Epicurean theory, upon the
same common principle, to wit, an cfflux of cor·
puscles from the substance perceived impinging against
the different organs of perception, and exciting their
appropriate powers into action. This doctrine, as
we have already seen, has undergone a considerable
degree of modification in the modern schools of phi· ,
losophy, with respect to the two senses our poet has
just discussed; those, I mean, of sound and vision.
As to those which remain, and on the elucidation of
which he is now entering, the Epicurean theory has
sustained no important variation ε their action being
accounted for from the stimulus of the corpuscles of
the substance perceivcd impinging against the nerves
of the perceiving sense.
