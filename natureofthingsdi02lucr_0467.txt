Boox VI. THE NATURE OF THINGS. 453

Ost, too, perchance‚ the bick'ring blast itself,
Borne ’gainst the clouds direct, the crash createst
For ragged oft in various shapes they fly, 1 3 5
Ramous and wavy, hence sonorous too;
As when the north-east whistles through the groves
The leaves all rustle, and the branches crack:
Or, haply else, the horizontal gust‚ ,
Urg’d on abrupt, may rend the cloud in twain. 140
For what its force here oft on earth we leam,
On earth where gentler, but where still its tage
Roots up the forest headlong from its base.
Work'd into billows, too, the clouds, at times,
Conflicting murmur as the torrent tide 145
Of streams or ocean by the tempest tosr.

oft springs the mar, too, when from cloud to cloud
Darts the blue lightning sudden: these, if fill’d
With limpid vapour, instant the fierce flash

Quench with vast clamour, as the red-hot steel 150

F resh from the forge wide hisses when the smith

Deep drowns its fury in the gelid pool.
