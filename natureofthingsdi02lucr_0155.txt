THE NATURE OF THINGS.

For pow’r sensorial doubtless from the soul

Derives; and hence, when sleep the senses locks,

Th' enfeebled soul itself to reason seems

'Worn out, and all ejecte-d into air.

Yet not entire: for then this mortal make

member, as observed in the last paragraph, may be
awoke or ¹·e-stimulated into action by the peculia}-
force and bent of the dream, while all the rest con·
tinue lethargic.

VI. If the organ of external sense, thus affected,
be that of hearing, a phaenomenon will occur, which
is speeifically noticed by our poet in Book V.
V.1182. but which, I believe, has never hitherto
been satisfactorily explained: the dreame'r must ne.
cessarily hear a bye-standcr who speaks to him ;--
and if, from the cause specified above, hc should
happen tu have talked in* his sleep‚ so as to give the
bye-stander some clue into the train of thoughts of
which his dream is composed, a conversation may
be maintained, and the byc-smnder, by dexterous
management, and the assumption of a character
which he finds introduced into the dream, be able
to draw from the dreamer the profoundest secreta
of his bosom : the other senses of the latter, instead
of rousing hereby‚ to deieci the imposition, being
plunged into a still decpci· lethargy, from the de-
mand of an increased quantity of sensorial power to
support the exhaustion which the wakesul or active
orgari is, in consequence, sustaining.

V11. If the wakeful nei-ves be the opica! alone,
the somnambulist, or dreamer who is accustoxned
ιο walk in hia sleep, will be able to make his way
towards any place to which the course os his dream
directs him, with the most perfect ease, and without
the smallest degree of danger. He will see :is clearly,
and perhaps, more so, as if generally awake: yet,
from the very exhaustion, aud, of course, incra-:used
torpidity ol' the other organs, in consequence of an
inereuscd demand of sensorial power from thc corn-
mon stoek, to support the aetion of the sense antl

muscles immediately engaged, every other sense must
necessarily be thrown into a deeper sleep or torpidity
than ori any other occasion. Hence the ears will
not be roused even by a sound that might otherwise
awake him ; he will bcinsensible, not only to a simple
touch, but a severe shaking of his limbs, and may
even cough violently without being recalled from his
dream. IIaving accomplished the object of his pur·
suit, he may safely return, even over the most dan-
gerous precipices, for lie sees them distinctly, to
his bed3 and the opticril nerves themselves, being
now quite exhaust& and the system at large inca-
pable ofaffording any addition ofsensorial power, the
torpidity must necessarily be rendered general aud
prosound—so profound‚ perhaps, as to destroy the
habitual action of the nervous tribules of the brain it-
self‚ and produce sleep without thought or dreaming.

Vlll. This phaenomcnon of somnambulism has
never, that I know ef, to the present day, been sa-
tisfactorily, or even plausibly accounted for. It sol-
lows necessarily, in conjunction with that of speaking
and conversing in sleep, from the theory os which l'
have now, sor the lint tinic,presentcd the outlines5 and,
