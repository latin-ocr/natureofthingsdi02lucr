Dextera ea propter nobis simulacra remittunt:

been of Egypt, and Cleanthes of Corinth. This seems
to have been a great improvement upon the style of
stroke orlinear drawing ; for although the former may
have been founded upon an observation of the effe-ets
of light and shade, and an attempt to introduce such
effects upon paper, yet, every attempt must, in

the first instance, and by the use of strokes alone, ”

have been harsh and inharmonious; it must have
wanted relies, and been incapable of exhibiting the
gradual softness, recession, and rotundity which are
every where to be met with in nature. This alone
is to be obtained, in any high degree, by the intro—
duction of colour,—although that colour be, asin
the present instance, a monochrome, 01-¹ simple indi-
vidual hue, diversified, as we must naturally suppose
it to have been. by the gradual admixture of some
other substance which, without presentiug any se-
cond hue, would progressively modulate its toncs:
as when black, for example, is the only tint resorted
to, and its different shades are produced by different
combinations of white. It is to these melodicus
combinations of tints‚ apparently opposite, in which
the black alone maintains the supoemacy, that the
Italians have given the name of chloro-scum, or clear
obscure. From this advantage gained to the art, it
is tasy to trace its ascent to the life aud harmony of
colouring properly so called—to the aeras of Panae-
nus, Polygnotus, and Zeuxis—to the exquisite paint-
inga uf the Paecile—-and the meridiari age of Apelles,

who, in the language of Cicero, consummated this
noble invention—“jam persecta,” said he, ‘⁸ sunt om-
m'a.'’ To draw a comparison between these and
others of equal celebrsty, and the painters of modern
times, would be as invidious as foreign to the plan I
have prescribed to myself. It is enough to observe,
that their excellence has been admitted, to its utmost
extent, by Raph'ziel and Poussin ; and we cannot err
in applauding thern after such antecedent panegyrice.

Upon the subjects of Grccian statuary and en·
graving, so nearly connected with painting, Ῑ have
not space to enter. The perfectiori of the former
art may be fully appreciated from the precious re·
liques which have descended to our own days ; and
that of the latter, from the description of the shields
of their heroes as presented to us by their poets.
But Ι ought not to forbear noticing‚ that amidst

many other proofs of their ingenuity, which are to-
tally lost to us, is to be enumerated their mode of
encaustic painting as well in wax as on ivery. Of
the inventor-s of these very curious arts we know no-
thing.—T11e style of painting in wax was in com-
mon use at least as early as the age of Anacreon,
who, as the friend of Polycrates of Samos, must
have flourished upwarxls of five hundred years ante-
rior to the Christian aerag for he expressly mentions
it in several places, and particularly in Ode xxviii. in
which he gives his directions to the perimet, who was
taking a likeness of his mistress.
