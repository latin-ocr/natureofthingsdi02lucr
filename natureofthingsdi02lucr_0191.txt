THE NATURE OF ‘fumos

Now flaunts in ribbands, in tiaras flames

F ull o’er her front, and now to robes converts

Of Chian loose, or Alidonian mould:

While feam, and festivals of boundless pomp,

And costliest viands, garlands, odours, wine5‚

And scatter'd roses ceaseless are renew’d.

But fruitless every act: some bitrer still

Wells forth perpetual from his fount of bliss,

The lowly dales will yield us anadems
To shade our temples ; ’tis a worthy moed ;
No better girlond seeks mine oaten rcede.

lt answers to the 0227 of the Hebrew Laflies, as

the tiara probably does to the ‘032 : both of which
form a part of the female wardrobe so amply detailed

by Isaiah. ch. iii. 18—24.

In the common editions and translations, we uniformly

find it :

Why this nnneccssary variat.on, which was first
suggested by Adr. Turnebus, should have been so

Thus, Dyer, in his Ruins of Rome:

Over their naked limbs, with wauton hand,
Sheds roses, odours, shcds unheeded bane.

passage may challenge, Ι think, all the efforts of all
the muses in every age and nation, as well for the

 

elegance of its numbers and imagery, as the sound
and important moral it contains. It should be read
and retained in his heart, by every libertine that
breathcs. Yet this is the poet who has been painted
to the vulgar as the captain-general of voluptuous-
ness and debauchcry !

Lambinus has observed, that he seems, in this
distich, to refer to the term γλυιυπιιιρς, (bitter-
sweet,) and more particularly to the following vene
os Musa-us, who employs it on a similar occasion:

Ηὲη και γλυκυτιιρον ῑῦιξατο κεπρω Epa-‘rm ι
She fclt the dulcet bitterness os love.

But there is a moral in Lucmius which is not even
hintcd at in Musaeus, and which is worth all the mere
verbal ‹lescripuons in the world.

In the following, from the Spanish os Pigneroa,
dcnorninated hy his own countrymtn, from· the beauty
of his pottry, the Divine, there is an idta somewhat
similar. and justly entitltd to nouccz

Mus eterno nmargor hall-i escondido,
