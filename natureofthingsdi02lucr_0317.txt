Boon V. THE NATURE OF THINGS. 303

Receding gradual, while they yet maintain
Their lambent fires, their radiance unimpair'd,
Scarce obvious dwindle,-must themselves alike

In size scarce vary from the form they show.

Nor deem it strange that so minute a sun 610
should poor forth flame sufficient heaven to fill,
And earth, and ocean, and whate'er exists
Tinge with its glittering dew3 for, from abroad
The myriad seeds of fire dispers’d at large
Through all thingS, here as to their fountain How, 615
And hence well forth o'er all th' exulting world
In boundless flood: see’st thou how small a spring
Feeds with its liquid treasures meads, full oft,

Of amplest breadth‚ and all their glebe o’erssows ?

Or the small globe of solat ssame‚ pemhunce, 620
Th’ effusive air may fise, than aught besides
Ignited easier by th’ imping'mg ray 3
As oft some casual spark the field enflames

Of full-ripe corn, or stubble crisp‚ and sere.

Or haply stores, impalpable to sight, 62 5

Of latent heat the rosy lamp surr0und‚
