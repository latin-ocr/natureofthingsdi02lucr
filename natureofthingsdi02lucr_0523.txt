Boot< VI. THE NATURE OF THINGS. 509

For fact itself proves earth throughout the same. 560
These truths premis’d‚ earth trembles, then, profound,
Shook into ruins, when the rage of time,
Deep down the caves immensely scoop'd below,
Tumbles th’ incumbent hills; abrupt they fall
With vast concussion‚ while, from scene to scene, 56 5-
Winds the dread tremour‚ propagated quick:
And well may wind ; since e'en the sluggish wain,
Though fill'd but half, as o'er the street it rolls,
Shakes every mansion3 since, alike disturb'd,
Quake they when, nean, the light aerial car 570
Drawn by sseet coursers whirls its ratt-ling wheels.
Earth trembles‚ too, when, undermin'd by age,
Wide into lakes of boundless breadth beneath
Th' incumbent glebe sinks sudden, her vast shell
By the deep dash far stagger’d‚ as the bowl 575
Reels, fill'd with fluid, when its fluid rocks.
