Ver. 1. Iuram: ῥακίων Itrmdmnrod ltcsorc] The
figure (lcnominated by rhetoric-iaus, iteratim, or amr-
phcra‚ may be dividcd into three kinds 3—Iiteml, or
that in which tlic same letter is repented, more frc-
qnently named alliteration; ‘vn-bal, in which we nttct
with a pnrposed recurrcncc of the same πνοιᾶς and
⁴perindie, or that in which wc trace a repetition of an
entire passage or sentence. To each of these Ln-
cretius appears to have been fondly attached; and
especially to the last, of which we meet with an
instance in the opening of the Book before ns ; the
whole of the first twenty-two verses being a mere re-
petition, with scarcely any variation, of what oc-
¹curs, in Book Ι. v. 988—1009.

Upon the second division into which 1 have thus
partitioned the anaphora, the iterative use of the
same word, and the frequency of its adoption by
other pects, I have offered some remarks, in the
note on Book 1. v. 877. Respecting both the first
and third, I shall only therefore briefly remark, that
no didactic poem affor-ds such frequent examples of
them as the present· Of the former, wc meet with
an instance not far from the beginning of the first
Book, v· 272-
venti vis verberat incita pontum.

 

In the very passage before us, v. 9, we meet with
another:

Carmina, Musaeo contingens cuncta lepore.

Of the latter, the examples are almost innume-
rable: and why this branch of the figure before us
has not been as frequently employed in heroic or di-
dactic versification as the two preceding, I am at a
loss to determine. Judiciously introduced, it has a
more prominent merit, and is, at all times, liable to
less abuse than either of the other branches of the
anaphora. Our poet, in the use he has made of it,
seems to have been occasionally influenced by an idea
of the intrinsic beauty of the passage itself‚ and, oc·-
casionally, by that of its argumentative importance,
as containing a maxim or elucidation which the reader
ought to keep perpetually stored in his mind. Of
the former motivc, I refer for instances, among
many others that might be enumerated, ‘to the pas-
sage now under considerantium to Book V. v. 117-
120 of this version, which is a literal repetition of
Book I. v. 796—7993 and to Book 1V. v. 185—
183, which is also literally copied into the same
Book v. 928—931. For proofs of the latter, the
render may compare Book 1. v. 729—-730, with the
