THE NATURE OF THINGS'.

Led on by PAN, with plne-leave garland crown’d‚

And seven-mouth’d reed his labouring lip beneath,

&Vaking the woodland MUSE with ceaseless song.
These, and a thousand legends wilder still
Recount they3 haply lest their desert homes

Seem of the gods abandon'd, boastful hence

Of sights prodigious ; or by cause, perchance,

More trivial urg’d, for ne'er was tale so wild

Fcign’d, but the. crowd would drink with greedy ears.

This nine-ton’d pipe, nice-modell’d by these
hands

And held by whitest wax in sweetest banda,

Here pledge 1.

This fistula, or syfinx, which, in its first and
nudent state, was, perhaps, formed of the stalks of
eat, or wheat‚ united together by wax, as stated in
the passages above, was afterwards manufactured
from substances much more firm and durable‚ and
united in a much more elegant and elaborate manner :
hence we read, not only of the avena, and stipula,
but of the calamus, arund0‚ buxus, tibia, cornu, and
τις all which substances were occasionally‚ and, per-
haps, progressive-ly resorted to: and hence the fistula,
or syrinx, may be regarded as the father ofanumerous
family. ,The modern church-organ izsclf cannot, in-
deed, be otherwise than attributed to the same source z
and the Hebrew urgan, or the musical instrument so
translated (3259 or 329), must much more nearly
have resembled the syrinx than the elaborate instru-
ment of this name in its present state os perfectiori ;
for there are various passages in the sacred writings
which intimate that it was of easy construction, and
played upon by the lips. Thus, in the supplemen-
αἱ psalm in the Septuagint, which ranks as the

hundred and fifty-first, David declares of himself
that when a shqghml, “ '

Ἀι χιιρεις μου ΕΠΟῙΗΣΑΝ 0PsANON,

Και ἐι dax-tumn μου {pp-ovea! ψαλτηριον.

My hands jbrm’d the orgum
And my fingers harmonized the psaltery.

VVhence Mr. Parkhurst ingeniously conjectures, that
the organ here referred to was the very pipe or syrinx
described in this identical passage of our own poet :
and explains, Ezek. xxxiii. 31, 32. in which the
same Hebrew term twice recum, as follows, “ For
they make (thy words) ffl'JJy, (lik'e) pipes in or at
their mouth, ι’. e. something to play or trifle with.
Ver. 32. Ami behold, thou art rothem fflinjy Ἶφψ),
as a song (sor) the pipes (i. e. to be sung with) qs
oue who has α pleasant voice, and is skilled in music.

As to the ‘¹ pine—leaved garland'' with which Lu-
cretius has here decorated the god of rustic scenery,
or rather of universal nature—noem το ΣΥΜΠΛΝ-
we know, from the testimony of a vast variety of the
lyric and bucolic bards of Greece and Rome, that
this was his appropriate dress. Thus Ovid:

 

sinu pucinai cornua Pana. Μετ. xiv. 6 38,
And Pan, hishorns withpine-leave chaplete wreath'd.

A passage that might be supported by m infin}
tude of similar tendency, is necessary.
