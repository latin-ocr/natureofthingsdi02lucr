THE NATURE OF THINGS.

Nought lives on earth the phantoms never ape.

Hence clouds concrete, th’ aerial vault serene

Shadowing with moisture, grateful as it moves t

Hence, shapes gigantic spread, protruding broad

Their interposing features ; mountains hence,

strous appearances in the atmoephere are not equally
common to all countries, but depend in a great mea-
sure upon local causes and combinatione. According
to Pliny, the regions of Scythia within Imaus, and,
according to Pomponius Mela, those of Mauritania
behind mount Atlas, are peculiarly subject to them 3
and they are generally regarded by the barbarous in-
habitants of such countries as spectres, or aerial de-
mons. Of such grotesque phaenomena, Diodorus Si-
culus makes particular mention in the fiftieth section
of his third book, and points out the regions of
Africa situate between the Syrtes and Cyrene, as the
theatre of their most extraordinary appearance :

‘¹ Even in the serencst weather there are sometimes
seen in the air certain condensed exhalations, that re-
present the figures os all kinds os animals; occasion-
ally, they seem to bc motionless‚ and in perfect qui-
etude; and occasionally to bc flying ; while, imme-
diately afterwards, they themselves appear to be the
pursuere, and to make other objecta fiy before them.'’
Thi· phaenomennn is, in reality‚ seldom observed, ex-
cept in serene weather ς und it should seem, upon every
theory yet offered to account sor it, from the ingeni-
ous explanation of our own poet to that of M. Monge
in the {xit-moira relative to Egypt, that such an atmo-
sphere is nearlylor altogether necessary to its existence.
The illusion has been norietd as frequently by modern
aa by ancient obser-vers: and M. Cmnn, in his His.

not essentially differing from the above just quoted
from Diodorus Siculus. It is not confined to any par-
ticular part osthe globe, but generally makes its ap-
pearance on the coast ς the atmosphere, as I have al-
ready observed, being commonlyclear and tranquil,and
the phaenomenon usually succeeded by a fall of rain.
Our own sailors, from its more general appearance,
call it a sog-bank; by many writers, it is denominat-
ed suta Morgana, and by the French, miragc.

For this atmospheric delusion, various causes have
been assigned, and especially by Kircher, Scholt,
and Gaspard Monge, who accompanied Bonaparte
in his Egyptian expedition aa one of the French 39²-
vans, and was a member of the Institute at Cairo:
yet no explanation I have hitherto met with, has
been given in satisfactory, or at least in popular lan-
guage.

To illustrate it as clearly as may be, it is neces-
sary, first of all, to call the reader's attention to the
variable state of the atmosphere, which is commonly of
an homvugeneous, or equable tenuity, and conse-
quently suffers the rays of the sun to permeate it
without any obstruction or change3 but at times is
irregular, and composed of parts or bodies of a den·
ser medium than it s general texture and constitution z
in which case the fluent ray, if it do not enter the
denser medium in :t direct or perpendicular line, will
be either πῆξαι-«1, or refracted, or both, and the ub-
ject surreycd through it asmme a new, and not un-
frequently a grotesque appearance.
