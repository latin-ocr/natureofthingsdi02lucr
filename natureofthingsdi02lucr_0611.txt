Boox VI. THE NATURE OF THINGS. 597

Told ir, for many a kindred symptom throng'd.

The mind’s pure spirit, all despondent, rav'd3

The brow severe3 the visage fierce and wild3

The ears distraeted‚ fill'd with ceaseless sounds; 1 2 30
Frequent the breath3 or pond’rous‚ oft, and rare3

The neck with pearls bedew'd of glist'ning sweat3

Scanty the spittle‚ thin, of saffron dye,

Salt, with hom-se cough scarce labour’d from the throat.

The limbs each trembled3 every tendon twitch’d 1 23 5
Spread o'er the hands3 and from the feet extreme

O’er all the frume a gradual coldness crept.

Then‚ tow'rds the last, the nostrils close collaps'd;

The nose acute3 eyes hollow ; temples scoop'd3

F rigid the skin‚ retracted 3 o'er the mouth 1 2 40
A ghastly grin 3 the shrivell’d forehead tense3

The limbs outstretch’d, for instant death prepar'd ;

Till with the eighth descending sun, sor few

Reach'd his ninth lustre‚ life for ever ccas'd.
