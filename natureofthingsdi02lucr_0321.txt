Boon V. THE NATURE OF THINGS. 507

Haply efficient, that the radiant signs,

As nearer earth affix'd‚ less rapid far

Roll in the heaven's vast whirlpool, heaven below

Gradual its race relaxing3 whence the sun, · 640
And solar satellites must more and more

Be backwards left, deserted, since full deep

Lie they beneath the blue etherial fires:

While the bright moon lies deeper still, and hence

Still powerless more, as nearer earth’s low bounds, 64 5
To match the speed the loftier signs display.

As tardier moves she in her proner path

Than moves the sun, as swifter o'er her rolls

The wond'rous vortex of sublimest heaven.

XVhence seems she speedier through each sign t' advance, 650
