Ver. 142. th’ acrial vaull serene

Shadowing with maiman, grateful as i! moves s]
There is some degree of uncertainty in the position of
these, and several of the adjoining verses, their rela-
tive situation differing in different editions. In a
translation, however, this is not a matter of essential
consequence, the general sense remaining the same
in every position. The verses now quoted are in the

original highly beautiful :

Cernimus et mundi speciem violare serenam:
A'e'ra mulcentes motu.

But many of the editors of our poet have not been sa·
tisfied with this elegant and picturesque delineation,
and have spoiled it by their crude and tasteless emen-
dations. Gifl‘anius, for “ a'c‘ra mulcentes‚’' rest-esb-
ing the hir, has introduced aera mulge-ntes “ impelling
or agitating tlie air ;’' and Faber, although he retains
mulcentes in his text, has apl-»ended the following
note: “ the celebrated Simon Bosius, to whom we
are indtbted for a corrected edition of the Epistles to
Atticus, approved the term mulcantcs, assaulting ; and
most judiciously‚ ifl have any c-rmprehension at all.''
Simeo Bosius, vir clarissimus cui emendationem Epis-
tolarum ad Atticum debemus, legi probabat mulcan-
ηε, optime si quid sapio. Des Coutures, in his Latin
text, bas followed the alteration of Ciminius, and in
his French version thus translates the passage: “ on
les, voit incontinent se grossir et troubler par leurs
mouvemens impetueux la face riante de l'univers.'’

 

 

Mr. Wakefield, with his accustomed taste, has re.

jected these depraved variations, and presented Lu-

cretius in his native excellence. Marchetti, in hio
version, has done the same τ

 

e la serena
Faceia turbar del mondo, e‘l cielo intanto
Lenir co'l moto.

The English translation οἷ Creech is so extremely
vague, that it has no corresponding term of any
kind: but Guernier has injudiciously adopted the
idea of Faber, in his English interpretation, while, in
direct opposition to it, he retains the term mulcenteis
in his Latin text, ‘⁸ we see the clouds sometimes
thickcn in the ssky, darkening the serene face of the
heaoens, and wounding the air hythe violence ⁰s their
mofflmff‘

The entire passage, in its true reading, is so ex-
tremely consentaneous with a description I have lately
met with of the same subject in Dr. Booker's Hop-
garden, a didactic poem of no small merit, that I shall
take the liberty of transcribing it ε

Hills, woods, and forests‚ shadowy vales, and plaina,
Capacious bayS, and promontories hug-e,

Fring'd with soft tufted foliage, Fancy sees

In those a'e'rial forms which rich& veil

The blue expanse of heaven.

In Thomson’s beautiful invocation to the Sprfflg,
he has caught the very spirit of the verse in question ς
and has embodied it in colours that glow with all the
tone of the Oriental pencil ε

Come, gentle Spring! etheria! deness, come:
And from the bosom of yon dropping cloud,
veiled in a shower

Of shadowing reses on our plains descend.
