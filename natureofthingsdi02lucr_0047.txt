THE NATURE OF THINGS.

³5

Hence, from like cause, the semblances of things

Through countless space must instantaneous rush 3

For equal powers propollent press behind,

And the same texture rears them that pcrvades

Forms most compact‚ and fills th’ aerial void.

200

If, too, those particles of things that lurk

Deep in th’ interior, oft sublimely bound,
And quit the surface, as the sun's pure light,
And lustre' fair, if instant these we view

Rush through all space, o'er earth and main diffuse,

205

And heaven's high arch, by utmost lightness wing’d3

Say, what the speed of atoms plac'd supreme,

getam, which clearly evince, that the presence or
necess of light is not absolutely necessary for the pro-
duction of colours in vegetablcs. “ This natumlist,''
observcsM. Mirbell, “has remarked a very green lichen
of an extraordinary size in subterraneous cavities
where the light never penetrated. Hc has raised in
the same excavations crocuses, whose flowers were
perfect& wel! coloured. He has deposited in the same
cavities the geranium odoratissimum of Linne'us, and
the messes named by Heduig Barbula ruralis, and
Neikera viticulosa: they have continued to vegetare,
and their grem colour has remained. These subter-
raneous cavities were filled with hydrogen to such a
degree, that the flame of a eandle was extinguished‚
and the lungs severely affected by its gass- Such ex-
perimenta, in connection with many others, induced
Humboldt to conceive, that hydrogen without light,
und with a small proportion of oxygen, is sufficient
sor vegetation.''

But if the eolours of plants depend upon oxygen

or hydr-ogen, or both, then must one or both these .

gasses be a constituent principle of light, from which
all colours are commonly derived. Yet light, instead
of being compounded of oxygen, has iuver-sely been
supposed of late by Mr. Davey, to enter into oxy-ge-
nous gass as a principle of this gass' itself. Be this,
however, as it may, it is obvious from these experi-
ments, that the colouring matter of light is capable
of existing, either with light or without it; and,
consequently, that light itself, agreeably to the Epi-
curean doctrine, is a compound body, and not an
elementary substance. From thc verses which intro-
duce this note, it seems to have been conceivcd by
this school, that the sun was a kind of luminous la-
boratory, prepan'ng the ejected fluid by some process
in its interior structure, as well ns propclling it from
its surface.
