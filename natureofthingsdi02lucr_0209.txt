THE NATURE OF THINGs

Of mutual bliss, and cheated to the yoke.

’ Whence o’er and o’er the bliss must mutual prove.

7 Listen to me, therefore, O young men!
And depart not from the words of my mouth.
8 Retread thy path far· from her,
Approach not the door of her house :
9 Lest thou surrender thy dignity to sti-angers,
And thy years to a cruel ⁸¹ task-master :'’
10 Lest aliens banquet on thy strength,
And on thy nerves in a foreign habitation.
ιι And in thine extremity thou bitterly lumem,
While thy flesh and thy bowels are consuming3
12 And exclaim, “ How have 1 hated instruction !
And my hear-t has despised reproof!
13 How have 1 disobeyed the voice of my teachers!
And withdrawn my ear from those who expostu-
lated with me !
¹4 From no evil scarcely have Ι rcfrained
In the midst of the congregation and the com-
munity.''—
ις Drink waters out of thine own cisterc,
Even running waters out of thine own well-spring;
16 Then shall thy streame flow abroad,
They shall be rivers of waters in the streets.
17 Thine, thine alone shall they be,
And no stranger shall claim them with thyself ε
18 Blessed shall be thy fountain
And joyful the wife of thy youth ;
18 As the lovely hind, and the graceful roe,
For ever shall her bosom ravish thee :
Thou shalt be intoxicated with the embraces of
her love—-
20 And why, my Son ! wilt thou bc intoxicant-d with
a wanton ?
And embrace the bosom osa strangcr?
21 Behold! the ways of such a man are before the
eyes of Jchovah ς
And he pondereth all his sootsteps.
22 His own iniquities shall entangle the wretch‚
Evcn in the cords of his own sins shall he bc en-
snarcd.
23 He shall pcrish void os instruction.
And shall bc crazcd nith the irnttnsity of hi>- sully.

In ch. vii. 5. of the standard version, 3720&
,ἾἾῙ is rendered “strange woman,’' and Π*Ἶ)],
“ strange1·:'’ the adjective, in the former expres-
sion, however, is derived from a root vshich signifies
to ⁴‘ disperse, dissipate, or dissolve,’' and is hence
more accurately, as wellas more elegantly rendered
“ from the dissipate& or “ dissolute,’¹ than “ from i
the strange woman.” The direct rendering of the
latter expression is ‘⁴ an alien, foreigner‚ or stran-
ger ;'’ but as the term also means “ a pretender, a
dissembler, a counterfeit,’' one who pretends to an
affection which does not exist, I have chosen the
word wanton as more immediately expressive of its
signification, in the present place, than any other.

Ver. 8. “ Walking in the way to his house,'’ is
commonly rendered “ to her house ;’' by which, half
the sense and beauty of the context is destroyed.
The incorrectness, however, is obvious: had he been
“walking in the way to her house,’' enticement
would have been unnecessary.

Ver. 22. “ Fast bound with cords, a terror even
to the fool.'' In the common version, which intro-
duces a new figure, “ as a fool to the correction of
the stocks.’' But if the Hebrew term, Djy, could,
with propriety, be interpretcd sunl-s, the literal trans-
lation would then be, conversely, ‘¹ as the stocks to
the correction of the fuolfi 029, however, docs
not mean storin„ but like its synonym in Arabic,

snbstantivcly3 or thc aet of chainiug or tying with
cords, if employed as n verb. I have, therefore,
with Schultens, continued the metaphor introduced
into the former part of the verse, and applied it to
the ux, which is hence represented as dragged by
cords to the daughter-house. The Septuagint‚ in
unison with the Chaldaic, Syriae, and Arabic, gives
