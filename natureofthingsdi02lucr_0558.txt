Tum fit odor vini plagae mactabilis instar.

Nonne vides etiam terra quoque sulfur in ipsa

Gignier‚ et tetro concrescere odore bitumen ?

Denique, ubi argenti venas aurique sequuntur,

Terra'i' penitus scrutantes abdita ferr03

Qualeis exspiret scaptensula subter odores?

Quidve mali fit, ut exhalent aurata metalla?

Quas hominum reddunt facies, qualeisque colores?

Nonne vides, audisve, perire in tempore parvo

Quam soleant ; et quam vita'i' copia desit,

Quos opere in tali cohibet vis magna, necesse est?

815

Hos igitur tellus omneis exaestuat aestus;

Exspiratque foras in aperta, promptaque, coeli.

Sic et Averna loca alitibus submittere debent

Mortiferam vim, de terra quae surgit in auras,

who remain in the cellar too long, or enter it un-
conscious of the foul vapour it contains3 sor they
instantaneously fall down, and are taken away ap-
parently dead.'’ The phrase membra domis, signifies
not the mere compartment alone in which the must
is placed, and which is necessarily filled with its soul

into which such effluvium is capable of penetrating.
And this sort of phraseology was supposed to be

of it occurs in Cicero ad Qiint. Fratr. iii. 1. and
another in Pliny, Epist. ii. 17.

The term nervis, I adopt from a happy emendation

made use of is generally servus, scr-uis, or firvis :—
the amended variation is trifling‚ and affords a com—

tures upon ferme, and Gronovius himself, with an
alteration wider still, upon mustum.

But the change proposed, and adopted by Gif-
sanius, is infinitely more wide and outrageous than
any of these. He contends, that the entire couplet
refers to the verse immediately before it, (in this
translation, 8.32·)³ that it proposes two other modes
of being released from the baneful effect of charcoal-
sumes, and should be read interrogatively‚ thus:

Aut nisi membra prius pertexit frigida servus ,Ρ
Aut sit odos vini plagae manabilis mora ?

And audacious as this lection appears, Man-chetti,
incapable of comprehending the common editions,
has fully adopted it z

o se le fredde
Membra innanzi non copre il fido servo?
