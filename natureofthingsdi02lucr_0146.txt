Herodotus, are not less t'nan thirty stet on every

from a single stone, although not less than seventy
feet in height, which constituted a part of the stu-

rock of marblc or granite, and, transported in one
undivided piece down the Nile from the moun'tains of
Arabia, to Thebes, Memphis, Tentyra, and other
cities. But, still'less, have we any conception of the
vast and tremendous mechanical powers employed by
Archimedes during the siege ofSyracuse, by mcansnof
which he completely baffled for three yearS, and would
have done so for ever, had it not been for a stratagem,
against which he could not possibly be on his guard,
the whole power of the Roman republic, and the ta-

balistae, or projecting wachines, were so artfully
concealed behind the walls of the city, that the
enemy knew not in what diret-tion to attack them,
or to avoid the effects of their fury. In reality, they
were so dexter-›usly conniveri, that they acted equally
in every direction, and at every distance, so that

showers of darts and flints, against which it was im-
possible to defend themselves. It was in vain, that

clothes, or grasped him round the body, and whirl-
ing him into the air, dashed out hia brains by the fall.
The Roman soldiers were at length so completely
terrificd, that if they merely perceived on the walls a
small piece of cord or wood, they fled with all their
might, believing that Archimeden was once more
about to open some dreadful machine against them.
Marcellus, in the mean time, who super-intended
the ficet, was in a still worse situation : for his ships
were assailed, whether immediately under the walls.
or at a distance, with such immense craggs and
showers of dans, that the stoutest of his quinque-
remes could not withstand the assauh, and his sailore
became quite dispirited by the certain destruction
with which every attack was accompanied. It was
at this time the consul invented an immense machine
to counteract the mechanism of Archimedes, and in
which he fully confided for success. He chained to-
gether sideways, in the strongest manner he was able,
eight of his stoutest gallies of different lengths, here-
by incorporating them into one moveable bridge,
which was to be rowed by the oars of the extreme
gallies alone. On this powerful basis he raised a
structure of a height superior to that of the towers of
the Syracusan ramparts, at the summit of which was
a platform, capable of containing a vast body of sol-
dier-s, and protected by parapets both in front and on
either side. This machine, which from its form he
called a sambuca, after the labour of many months,
and the expenditure of an incredible sum of money,
he at length completed ; it was manned ; and the ob·

tomed to work their battering ranis, near the foot of
the wall: for when, at length, after infinite fatigue,
and loss of men, they had thus far obtained success,
this inimitable enginecr discharged such immense
beams and masscs of rock upon them in a perpendi-
cular line, as crushed their covered waggons‚ and
broke their battem'ng rams to atoms. If any one,

part of the circumvallation which defended Acra-
dina : it approached slowly on account of its weight
and bulk, and the fall of Syracuse appeared irreme-
diable. Archimedes, however, did not think it 80:
he suffered it quietly to advanee within his own reach,
and then began to bombard it by the incessant dis-
charge, from one of his engines, ofa vast rock of
a weight not less, according to Plutarch, than ten
quintals or talents, which at one hundred and twenty-
