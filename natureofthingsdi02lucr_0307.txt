THE NATURE OF THINGS.

Steering the course the gliding planets point,

Themselves hence sole propell’d3 while that below

Flows adverse, and the nether sphere drives on,

535

As drives the tide the mill’s unwearied wheel.

Yet, if unmov'd the heavenly orb we deem,

Its fires may still revolve z some restless seeds

Of all-elastic ether, close pent up,

Panting for ease, may· agitate their bans,

540

And round the sky's refulgent concave whirl.

Or air absorb'd extrinsic may,

alike,

With restless rage compel them3 or themselves

of the same theory; who certainly appears to have
appealed to no principle whatever, but to mere. facts
alone. For, elegant and harmonious aa was the Co-
pernican system on its first publication, it was theory,
and nothing beyond: it being reserved for future
astronomers‚ and for Newton, more than all the rest,
to demonstrate that this elegant theory was an in-
controvertible truth, to give solidity to conjecture,
reality to fancy3 and to ascen-min and discriminate
the laws by which it was regulatcd: laws as eom-
prehensivc in their operation as they are simple in
their structure, and which (qnally apply to separate
atoms 3ηά to congregated worlds. In consequence
of which, we feel oursdvcs compellcd to abjure the
principle herc alluded to by our poet, of confined
clastic ether, beautiful as it is in itself, and to em.
bracc that, in its stead', of mutual attraction or gra-
vitation.
