THE NATURE OF THINGS.

115

Since the fierce lion, as the muse has taught,

sight, then, surveys from semblances alone,

770

Nought but mere semblances the mind can rouse3

Hence seen the same, ot but attenuate more.

Thus only, when the limbs dissolve in sleep,

The wakeful spirit of the mind descries

Trains of unreal objects, mov'd throughout

775

By the same images the day displays;

So mov’d that those oft obvious seem to spring

Whom long the grave has folded in its grasp:

the present occasion5 but proceed to obser-ve, that
the volumes already published by the French Na-
tional Institute furnish us with several other the-
ories upon the same subject, of which the most com-
pact, and, at the same time, the most' profoundly
studied‚ appears to be that of Μ. Cabanis, (Tom. i.
Mor. et Polit.) which iS, nevenheless, little more
than an improvement upon the prior hypothesis of
Μ. condinae, as communicated in his very excellent
Traite‘: des sensations. Upon the theory of M. Ca-
banis, perception, instinct, thought, are but so many
modifications of the faculty of sensation. But what,
at length, is the cause of this faculty of sensation ?
‘⁴ This is a question,'’ observes he, at the termi-
nation of his very long, and very elaborate memoin
⁴‘ which no philosopher will think of proposing. We
only acquire ideas of objects by the phaenomena they
present : their nature or their essence can only exist,
as to onrsclves, in the: common mass of such
phaenomena. The ultimate laws of nature, as well
as their canses. must for ever remain inscrutable
to human investigation. In a word, they are be-
cause they are : and we ought no more, at the pre-
sent day, to attempt an explanation of sensatior: in
animal nature. than of ateraciion in the nature of
atoms.'’

Ver. 774. ——spirit osthe mind ] A
poetic pkonasm, highly elegant and forcible in de-

lineating the superlative degree either of qua·
lities or things.

 

In the original, mens animi, as
if he had said “ the purest and most volatile part
of the soul: that which is still awake and at-
tentive, when all the grosser faculties of the ani-
mal frame are sunl< in prosound sleep.’' Hence trans-
lated by Marchetti‚ but, I think, with much loss of
energy ε

Della mente i! vigor.

In Book VI. v. 1128. we meet with the same
phraseology ε
The mind's pure spirit all-despondent rav’d:

And not dissimilar hereto, Book III. v. 285 z
And lives as soul os e'cn thc soul itself;

to the Note on which verse the reader may tuin for
a variety of parallel idioms. The chernists of the
present day adopt a similar mode uf expression in
their terme, spirit oswine, spirit oscaebcr, spirit ⁰s al-
cohol. meaning hereby the purest and most volatile
part of these volatile substancez. See, also, Note
on Book V. v. 155. where the same figure is again
reeorted to.
