THE NATURE OF THINGS.

And night augments, and day curtails its course,

Since the same sun, earth under and above

Revolving‚ ether with unequal curve

Cleaves, and to parts of magnitude unlike

Severs the globe3 alternate this o'er that

Prevailing gradual till the nodes he reach

VVhere night and day assimilare their reigns.

For, in the central realms ’twixt north and south,

His utmost wwderings, midway‚ heaven divides:

So transverse winds the star-enamell'd path

Through which his mazy steps the seasons lead,

With ray oblique illuming earth and sky.

For thus they hold the heavenly orb who mark

Throughout arrang'd with constellations fair.

Ver. 710. th'th ray obquue illuming earth and sky]
Thus Vin-gil, in verses worthy of our own poet :

via secta per ambas,
Obliquus qua se signorum verteret ordo.
Geoac. i. 238.

 

Twixt the two zones a path oblique inclines,

where, in refulgent order, roll the signs.

Ver. 712. Throughout arrang’d with consti-[latioris
sain] The great body of fixt stan-s survcycd

in the firmament, have been immernoiially divided
imo dustinct clustcrs or constellations, for their <aner
discrimination. These clustcrs amount in the whole
to butun-en fou-ty and fifty, and take their names
from an irnagincd rascnibluicc to different animula. or
othei- ἣρω-(3 we arc acquainted with vn earth. The
zodiac consists of twclvt· of these signs, or clusters of
aare: or, in other words, the sun passu through

twelve of them in his annual path round the earth3
and it takes him up about a month to complete the
space in the heavens occupied by each: and he is
said to be in one of those signs, when he appears in
that part of the celestial §phere in which such sepa-
rate cluster of star-s i< sinuare. According to Ara-
tus, Astraeus was the inventor of this artificia! and
useful division of the heau-ns : whence Germanicus,

in his Latin version of this poet :

——fama parentem
Tradidoe astrorum.
