DE RERUM NATURA.

Qua tenus hoc simile est illi, quod mente videmus,

Atque oculis, simili fieri ratione necesse est.

this subject, he found that what hc denominatcd the
secondai‘y qualitics of bodies, as he chuses to call
thcm‚as colour, sound, uste, smell‚ and heat, have
no real existence in the bodies themselves that are
perceioed, which have only a power of cxciting such
perceptions in the brain, and oscoursc that they exist
only in our idens3 yet all the primary qualities of
bodi-ts, that is to say, those which mankind appre-
hend to bc absolutely inszparable from bodies theni—
,ῆι-1ης, such as solidity, extension, figure, number,
motion, and rest‚—these hc contended to have an ac-
tual existence in external objects, and to propagate
a resemblance of themselves to the ideas of the
uliud.

It has fairly and frequently been inquired, what
are these ideas, by which wc pei-ccivc external ob-
jects? which are neith-:r mind nor body, buta me-
dinm between the two, and which possess in them-
sch-es more than half the qualitics that are ordinarily
attributed to the latter? And whence,again, do we be-
come informed that such secontlary qualitics ofbodits
exist in these ideas any more than their priinary quali-
ties ? Why may not ligure, solidity‚ number, motion,
and rest, as fully depend upon ideas alone, as colour,
anund, taste, smell, or beat ? Bishop Beris-ky, there-
fore, who pursued this subject with a still bolder
spirit than Mr. Locke‚ convinccd himself that these
primary qualities of the latter philosopher were no
more inseparable from bodies than his secondaryg
that, like the former, they are rncre sensations or ideas
in ourselves, and that the bodies to which they are
supposed to attach, have nothing more than the
power of cxciting such sensations. Berkeley, there-
fore, discat-ded all sensible qualities from external
objects‚ and transferred them to the ideas or sensa-

no material world at all ι the whole which remained
was mind and ideas ; and he perceivcd clearly, or so
pretended to perccive‚ that there was no more soli-
u'ity in the different soenes, events, and persons whom
hc {md formerly supposed to exist around him, than

in the different scenos, events, and persons of a
dream.

It rnnst have been some consolation to him, how-
ever, that he himself did not vair-..h away in this ge-
neral disappearance of nature : that he still kept firm
possession os his own identity and immaterial spirit,
But the very same mode of rcasoning that induced
him to relinquish the material world, if he had legiti-
mately putrued it to its utmost consequenccs, would
have destroyed the existence, both of his own mind,
and his personal identity. And it was thus pursued
a short time afterwards by ΜΓ. Hume, and the soul
was absolutely swept away, and nothing lest behind
but impressions and ideas : sensations without a sen-
tient being, which succced each other with extreme
rapidity, and devoid of all necessary connexion ; and
which, though frequently possessing a most striking
similarity‚ can afford no proof of uniform identity of
existence.

Beyond these two last theories it has not been pos.
sible to advance, and to correct thern has been es-
tccmed a vain attempt. The very principles which
have led to such extraordinary conclusione, it has
been asserted, must be erroncons; and two distinct
and very opposite systems have lately been brought
forwmds, in which these principles have been totally
discarded.

Of these τωο, the first I shall notice is that ofCorn-
mon Sense, invented about a century ago by the inge-
nious Buffierof Paris, but principally indebted for its
reputation‚ at present, to the abilities of Dr. Reid,
Dr. Beaffle, and several other Scottish metaphysi-
cians of high rcnown, who have improved, and stre-
nuously defended it. Rejecting all knowledge of
the mode by which the impressions of objectu are
made upon the external senseS, and perceptions, in
consequence, are excited in the mind, but, at the sarne
time, peremptorily denying that either are produced
by images or ideas, this theory is built upon the ba-
Our perceptions, it is
asserted, necessarily imply the belief of the present
existence of external objecta 3 and the actual and un-

sis of intuitive apprchensmn.
