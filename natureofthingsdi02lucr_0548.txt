534. DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. VI.

Inpositum est, quia sunt avibus contraria cunctis,
E regione ea quod loca quom venere volantes,
Remigiom oblitae, pennarum vela remittunt,
Praecipitesque cadunt, molli cervice profusae,

In terram, si forte ita fert natura locorum;

Aut in aquam, si forte lacus substratus Averni.

Is locus est Cumas apud; acri sulfure montes

Obpletei calidis ubi fumant fontibus auetei.
Est et Athenaeis in moenibus, arcis in ipso

Vertice, Palladis ad templum Tritonidis almae,

750

Quo numquam pennis adpellunt corpora raucae

Cornices; non, quom fumant altaria donis.

Yield to desire ! 0 ! quit restraint,

Deep was the cave, and downward as it went,
In life’s delicious Eden faint ;

From the wide mouth, a rocky, rough descent ;
And here th' access a gloomy grove defends ς
And here th’ unnavigable lake extends,

O’er whose unhappy wate-rs, void of light,

No bird presumes to steer his airy flight;

Such deadly stenches from the depth arise,

And steaming sulphur, that infecta the skies.
From hence the Grecian bards their legends make,
And give the name Avernus to the lake.

Davum.

While aloey sans the gales employ,
And odours heighten nature's joy.

Ver. 769. And first their namesrom power adverse
to birds
Draw they .-

 

] The Avcrni are caverns
in the earth, opening externally, and emitting an ef-
ssiivium injurious to animal life, but particularly to
the life of birds; whence they derive their name;
α’ being a privative particle, and opvoq signifying
‘- a bird.’' Of these Averni our poet notices three,
all of which were conceived, by the multitude, to
be the immediate portals to the infernal rivers and

regions. The whole of these circumstances are thus
related by Vin-gil ε

Ver. 7 7 2. ‘Their-pinion'd oars, ] Hence, ovid:
Posse super fluctus alarum insistere remis
Optastis. Μετ. v. 558.

 

On pinion’d σαν-,τ o’er ocean would ye fain

Urge your bold voyage.
Spelunca alta fuit, vastoque immanis hiatu,

scrupea, tuta lacu nigro nemorumque tenebris ς virgil has paid due attention to the whole of this

Qam super haud ullae poterant impune volantes
Tendere iter pennis ε talis sese halitus atris

Faucibus effundens supera ad convexa ferebat ς
Unde locum Graii dixerunt nomine Avernum.

places. The following affords us one instance :
