THE NATURE OF THINGS.

While o’er herself each sign but fleeter flies.

Or different airs, perchance, at times defin’d,

Rush o’er the converse hemispheres of earth ;

This the moon driving from the summer fires

Down tow’rds the wintry arc, and realms of ice3

And that, alternate, raising her again

From frost's drear solstice to the sultry signs.

Thus moves the sun too, haply, and the stass

Alternate thuS, by converse airs propell'd,

Roll their vast rounds, and fill the mighty year.

See'st thou not oft, from different winds, the clouds

Above‚ borne different from the clouds below?

and once more exhibit themselves in the same relative
positions; or, as Polignac has it in verse ε

Annorum tredecim bis millia tota necesse est
Effluxisse prins, repetant quarn sidera sedem,
Primaevusque situs toti reddatur Olympo.

Amr-Luca. viii. 424.
Fun thirteen thousand years twice told must roll
Their mighty round, cre heaven resume its face,
And every star its primal station take.

But that the poet is here merely deser-ibing the re-
volution of the solur year, or the sun‘s path through
the zodiac‚ we may accurata-ly determine from the
following parallel delineation of Virgil :

Interea magnum SOL circumvolvitur‹mnum-

Meanwhile the suu rulls round the mighty year.

To which, if confirmation were wanting, it might
be obtained from the cnsning passage of Seneca :
Hic, qui. sacris pervius astris
secat obliquo tramite zonas,
Flecteris longos Sigmscr· annos

Lapsa videbit sidem tabens.
Tnnsr. 847.

This zodiac thick with spanglcs sown,
That cuts oblique-ly every zone,

Bends the longycar, all variance bars,—
shall fade amid the fading stars.
