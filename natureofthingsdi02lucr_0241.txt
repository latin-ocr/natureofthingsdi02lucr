Boon V. THE NATURE OF ‘ss‘fflNGs

DriveS, not by arms, but precepts suge and pure—-
Say—ought not this man with the gods to rank ?
Since of themselves, too, and in strain divine,
Much to the sace of mortals he disclos'd‚
And op'd the nature of created things.
His steps I follow; and, by him illunsd, 60

Unlock the laws whence first the world uprose:

Laws that still guide it, and tc utmost time

Will guide resistless 3 whence the human soul

KVas stampt corporeal, impotent to live

Age after age triumphant o'er decay, 6 5
Proving that nought but phantoms cheat the mind,

When oft in sleep we dcem the dead appear.

What then, in order, waits us but to sing
How nature’s perishable system sprang,
As sure of fate as erst of natal hour3 70

How, from the mass material, heaven and earth,
Sun, moon, and stass, harmonicus swell'd to life:
What animated tribes, from age to age,

Have peopled space, and what have never liv'd:
