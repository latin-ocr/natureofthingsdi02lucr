THE NATURE OF THINGS.

ClogS, and the semblances of things arrests.

View yon square turrets, too, that guard our state

Frofn hills remote, and each appears rotund.

Hence solve the vision3 that,

All angles soften3 first survey'd obtuse,

Then fading total; the dilated orb

Attaining never, or devoid of force :

For the light image, through the flutt'ring air

As swift it glides, abrades at every point.

Hence, as each angle flies the prying sight,

Cylindric seems the structure, distant far

From the true circle, but cylindric still.

The shade, moreo'er, moves with us in the sun,

Attends our stepS, and every

Moves, or so seems, if terms like these apply

To aught like shadow, the mere void alone

Of light, and lustre.

Such the phase evinc'd,

Thou thus resolve it; that, whene'er we walk

Ost round the sight deems what in truth is square .·
An error soon corrected by approach.

Ver. 386. ——ehe mere void alone
Os light. and [turre. ] The doctrine here
advanccd upon shadows is perfectly consentaneous to
the philosophy of the present day, and the solution
os the problcm adduc-ed is as applicable to the theory
of Ncwton as os Epicurus: the former of whom, in

 

describing the laws of the projection of shadows
from opake bodies, zella us expressly, that shadow
is the mere privation of light3 and that as every
opake body projecta a shadow in the same din-<tion
with the rays of light, that is, towards the pan op·
posite the light, as the luminary or the projecting
body changes place, the shadow must necessarily
change place in the same proponion.
