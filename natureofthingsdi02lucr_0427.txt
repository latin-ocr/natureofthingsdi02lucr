Boon V. THE NATURE OF THINGS. 413

His form to harden, nerv'd with double force. 1 39 5

But nature’s self th’ untutor'd race first taught
To sow, to graft3 for acorns ripe they saw,
And purple berries, shatter'd from the trees,
Soon yield a lineage like the trees themselves.
VVhence learn’d they, curious, through the stem mature 1400
To thrust the tendet slip, and o'er the soil
Plant the fresh shoots that first disorder'd sprung.
Then‚ too, new cultures tried they, and, with joy,
Mark’d the boon earth, by eeaseless care caress'd,
Each barbarous fruitage sweeten and subdue. 1405
So loftier still, and loftier up the hills
Drove they the woocllands daily, broad'ning thus
The cultur'd foreground, that the sight might traee
Meads, corn-fields, rivers, lakes, and vineyards gay,
O'er hills ancl mountains thrown ; while through the dales, 1410
The downs, the slopes, ran lavish and distinct
The purple realm of olives3 as with hues
Distinet, thoughvarious still the landscape swells

Where blooms the dulcet apple‚ mid the tufts

—the tendet clustcrs grow indcbtcd to thia· exquisite picture of our pon sor 1¹1

With purple ripencss, and invest each hill
Aa with the blushes of an cvcning sky. i. 282.
