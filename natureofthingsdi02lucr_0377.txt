Boon V. THE NATURE OF TIIINGS. 363

Could aught indulge but ineffectual ire:
Nor, lull’d to calms, could e'er his traitor face 1020
Lead‚ o'er the laughing waves, mistrustful man,
Untaught the dangerous science of the seas.
Then want consum’d their languid members, now
Full-gorg'd excess devours us: they themselves
Fed, heedless, oft with poisons; ofter still 102 5
Men now for others mix the fatal cup.
Yet when, at length, rude huts they first devis'd‚
And fires, and garments ; and, in union sweet‚
Man wedded woman, the pure joys indulg'd
Of chaste connubial love, and children rose, 1030

The rough barbarians soften'd. The warm hearth

And leading all his life at home in peace Though the fierce North oft smotc with iron whip
Always in sight of his own smoke, no scas Their shivering limbs, though oft the bristly boar
No other scas he known, nor other torrent Or hungry lion woke them with their howls,
Tban that which waters with his silver current And scar’d them from their mess-grown caves to
His native meadows: and that very earth τους

Shall give him bUU'ssl, Which first gave him birth· Houseless and eold in dark tempe-smnus nights ;
