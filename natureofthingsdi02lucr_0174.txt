DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. lv.

Semen3 adulta aetas quom primum roborat artus,

Namque alias aliud res commovet, atque >lacessit3

Ex homine humanum semen ciet una hominis vis 2·

Quod simul atquc suis ejectum sedibus exit,

Per membra atque artus decedit corpore toto,

Iu loca conveniens nervorum cerra3 cietque

Continuo parteis genitaleis corporis ipsas:

Inritata tument loca semine, fitque voluntas

scription of either, and particularly of the latter, im-
propcr sor general perusal. In plain and cautious
prose, they are topics which ought not to be indis-
criminatcly submitted to the eyt- of every oue ; but
when delivered with the necessary det-orations, aud in
the glouing language of poetry, a still greatzr cii·-
cumspectiou should be adopted, even admitting that
the utmost degree of address is eviuced in the choice
of vcrhiage. *set why then, it may be iuquired, did
not the poet abstain from such topics altogether?
am? why, more particularly, are they not omit-
ted in the present version ? For the very reason that
Lucretius thought proper to introduce them, 1 have
not thought myself at liberty to supprcss them.
They are subjecta that ought to be treated of, and
that must bc treated of in some way or other: they
naturally sall within the scope of a poem, written ex-
pressly upon Tun NArer. or Tumcs: there is a
moral 111 the former, sojust, and so pointed, that every
libertine ought scrioualy to peruse, avd minutely to
ponder upon the whole picture delineated : aud
amidst the dullness and obscurity generally attendant
upon the latter, our poet is entitled to the conjoint
thanks of naturalists and anatomical philosophus, for
irradiating their darlt and thoruy paths with the light
and fue of the musis. W'liile exquisitcly elegant aud
iuxitiug, our poetic lectum- is at the sanic time uni-

formly delicate and graie ; nor do 1 know any de-
scription of persons, to whom subjecte of this kind
ought to be communicated in any shape, but might
be prudently entrustcd with the conclusion of the
Book before us.

In thc discmsion of illicit love, Lucretius proves
himself to be a moraliat well acquaintcd with human
life, and delivers his advice from observation and ge-
neral experience. He allows to the gallant all the
pleasures sor which he can contend ; he paints them
in language which the libertine himself cannot call
cold or inadequate: he developes all the fond emotions
of his heart; he accompanice him through all his
§cenes of delirious rapture: he concedes to him every
thing he can desire: and he then comptis him to
contemplate his end. He proves to him, from a
picture of life ita-If, that his destruction is inevitable ;
and that, however happy and prosperous hc may be
in the mmet, or even the middle of his journey, his
ultimate perdition is as sure as if he were plunged
imo it from the first. Hiu general corollary is that
of Solonion upon a similar discussion of the same
subject, Eccl. x. 9 z “ Rejoice‚ O young man, in thy
youth, and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of
thy youth ·, and walk in the ways of thy beart, and
in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for
all these things, God will bring thee intojudgment.''
