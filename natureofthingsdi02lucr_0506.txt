DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. Vi.

Vis, et fervorem mirum concinnat in undis.

Vorsabundus enim turbo descendit, et illam

Deducit pariter lento cum corpore nubem:

Quam simul ac gravidam detrudit ad aequora ponti,

Ille in aquam subito totum se inmittit, et omne

Excitat ingenti sonitu mare, fervere cogens.

Fit qnoque, ut involvat venti se nubibus ipse

Vortex, conradens ex aere semina nubis ς,

Et quasi demissum coelo prestera imitetur.

Heio, ubi se in terras demisit dissoluitque,

Turbinis inmanem vim provomit, atque procellat.

Sed, quia fit raro omnino, monteisque necesse est

Oblicere in terris; adparet crebrius idem

Prospectu maris in magno, coeloque patenti„

The eager horse-leech, fixing on her lips,

Till the gorg’d glutton‚ swell'd beyond her size,

Drops from her wounded hold, and, bursting‚
dies.

So brusts the cloud, o'erloaded with its snight,

And the dash’d ocean staggers with the weight.

described the phaenomenon with an accuracy thar
