THE NATURE OF THINGS.

Why waves the god, moreo'er‚ the serpent-flash,

Why rolls the thunder ne'er in cloudless skies ?

When throng the gathering clouds, adown the storm

410

Descends he first, that, from a nearer point,

With surer aim, his javelin he may dart?

Yet why attack the ocean? o'er the waves
VVaste his wild ire, the floods, and liquid fields ?

If, too, he mean mankind the bolt should miss

415

Why form its structure viewless to the sight?

While, if he hope to strike us unprepar'd,

Why flash‚ conspicuous, and invite escape ?

Why first fill heaven with groans and darkness dire Ρ-

Then, canst thou deem him competent at once

420

Through various points to thunder? or the fact

Dar'st thou deny that many a fatal bolt

Falls at the same dread moment ? while the year,

Ceaseless, such fact renews, and proves precise

That as the showet at once o'er many a scene

425

Rushes amain, so darts th’ etherial shaft.

whose words are cited by Lambinus on the present
occasion, de Meteor. ii. 9. aum δια τι ποτε ‘mmo γιγιι-

τω κατα τον ουρανον, ὅτ αν mancam ῃ μονον, αλλ’ ονχι

συνεχως ὅντως· αιθριας δ’ ovo-nc, ου *Ity-nrm.

poet, de Divinat. ii. Qid enim proficit cum in
