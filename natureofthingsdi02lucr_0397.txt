But, vainly wearied, let them their life-blood
Sweat out, thus lab'ring up the tortuons steep‚
O’er which, like lightning, Eva brews her storum,
Fond of high stations—since to tales they trust 1 ι 5 5

Soon rous'd to trample what too much they fear.

Striving for office, and superior sway.
Yet order hence re-issu’d: some, at length,
