THE NATURE OF THINGS.

161 ⁴

F irst spring when manhood first the frame confirms.

And as on‘various functions var10us powers

Alone can act propulsive, human seeds

1060

By nought but human ›beauty can be rous'd.

These, when once gender’d‚ from their cells minute

O'er every limb, o'er every organ spread,

Crowd in full concourse towards the nervous fount

By nature rear'd appropriate3 whence abrnpt

Excite they oft, as forms of beauty fise,

The scenes at hand, the regions rul'd by love.

On the doctrine of animal generation, Lucretius is
a lecturer upon natural philosophy: he admits us to
his them-e, and gravely and scientifically developes
the principles of this important subject ε he nnlocks
the causes of barrenness and fertility : he traces the
nascent embryon from the first moment of copulation ;
and unfolds the principles which were supposed to
determine its sex. A serious and attentive render of
this truly learned, as well as poetical discourse, whe-
ther male or female, cannot possibly, 1 think, pe-
ruse it without the aequisition of some degree of
useful knowledge; and even the medical professor
himself cannot but be astonished at the copiousness
of itu research, and the accuracy that accompanies
much of its reasoning. i

To thiu defence of Lucretius I have been com-
pelled, from the unpardonable ill treatment hc has
uniformly met with from all his English translator-s,
in the-{r version ofrhis part of his poem, and the unde·
stru-ed aspersioni: which have, in consequence hereos,
been too generally thrown upon his character. With
Drydeu the defarnation began: his loose and lihi-
dinous muse was but ill-calculated ιο decorate sub-
jecta of this description with a chaste and delicate
attirc ; and, in his hands, Lucretius becomes a profli-
gate and a debauchee instead of‘a moralist aud phy-
‚ait-ian. To him succccdcd Cret-ch, who, glad os

the assistance that lay before him, instead of trans-
lating for himself, introduced, into his own version,
at the close of this Book, the lewd, lasciviens ri-
baldry of his predecessor. But of au who have at-
tempted to give interpretations of this part of our
Poem, in any language‚ Guernier is by far the most
unpardonable. With a modesty that would be al-
most deemed affectation in a female, he blushingly
tells us that he can translate no farther. The rea-
der will, in consequence, suppose that here, there·
fore, he drops abruptly his pen : or that, if hc insert
any thing more, it will be the Latin text alone. But
no such thing: this very modest man, who blushes
at the grave and scientific descriptions of Lucretius,
and can translate no sarther hirnself, transcribes, into
his own page, the gross obscenity of Dryden in its
stead, and offers it, to adopt his own expression, as
a vigorous interpretation of the original. Justly, in-
deed, does Bayle observ-e, upon this very portion of
our Pocm: il y a une grande difference entre les
po'c'tes qui publient dessaletes {1 la muniere de Catulle et
d’Ovide‚ et les poetes qui, pour expliquer les ‹ffizn
de la nature, sont oblige's de se servii de muts ob-
scenes. Lucrece est un poete physieien, et les autres
font des vers galans z illm· ert permis dt· se servir du
style des medicines; mais l'obseenite n'cst point snp-
portuble dans das vers de galamciic. Diet. ΛΠ. Lucr.
