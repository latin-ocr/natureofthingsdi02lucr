Boon V. THE NATURE OF THINGS. 249

Weakly and void of every vital aid,

When nature first, amid his mother's pangs,

Casts the young burden on the realms of light3

And leaves to pine full sore, as well he may,

That e’er the suffering lot of life were his. 240
While herds, meantime, and beasts of various name,

F lourish at ease3 no rattles they require,

No broken lullaby of dandling nurse,

Nor varying dress adapted to the‘day:

Nor arms they need, nor garners to protect 245

Their boarded treasures, earth and nature boon

To each acceding every latent wish.

And since earth, ocean, heat’s redundant stream,

And the light spirits of the gentle airs,

less than other animals ; who, as soon as they drop Sonorous tristes, useless, and to him

from the womb, instantly find the use of their feet, Incomprehensible : dcbm‘r'd meanwhile

and frolic about in their respective spor-ts, prepared From action which invigoratcs the frame,

for the atmosphcre by a protection of natural clothing. And evei-y curionis sense directs to things
