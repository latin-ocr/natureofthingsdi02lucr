THE NATURE OF THINGS.

261

And rush not oft huge craggs, from mountain heights

Hurl'd headlong‚ *powerLess to resist the fage
Of finite time? for had they flourish'd firm
From time eternal, they had flourish’d still.

View this vast concave that above, almund,

Folds all creation in its mighty grasp;

This whence, as some tell, all first rose, and where

All shall at last return—this too exists

Create and mortal ς for whate'er augments

Aught else, and nurtureS, must itself decrease,

Repair'd alone by matters re-absorb'd.

Yet grant this heaven, this earth ‘the heaven smrounds,

Time ne'er produc'd‚ eternal of themselves—

Whate’er it be, tis this that all inspires,
Formo, feeds, augments‚ erentes, and to itself
Takes back, the parent and the grave of all ε
Hence all rc-issues, and here all returns.

Itis probabit, however, that the first hint os both
the above passages was derived from Ennius, who
was a near relation of Pacuvius, and generally rc-
ported to have been his uncle.
Vides, sublime fusum, immoderatum, rubera,
Qi terram tenero circumjectu amplectitur.

satisfactorily from Plutarch, Plae. Phil. i. 3. Aa·
