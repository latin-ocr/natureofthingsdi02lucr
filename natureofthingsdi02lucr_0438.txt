with the superstitious of the ages or nations in which
they were originally invented, and hence to be so many
pictures of the deitics they worshipped, or of the
temples, altars, rites. or ceremonies connected with
such worship; while a third division ofinquirers, again,
believes them to have derived their van'ous forms from
the clavicles and sprigs of treeS, and especially of those
trees which have been peculiarly appropriated to reli-
giousveneration: among which philologistsIought not
to forget to rank Mr. Davies, the learned author ofthe
Celtic Researches, whose fancy has hurried him so far
back upon this subject as to conjecture that letters were
known in the garden of Edem and that the tree, from
the variable ramitications of which their variable figures
were produced, was the free ofknowledge itseff.
Admittiug then that in different countries different
alphabets have had different inventors—the only ques-
tion which remains to be resolved is, what country
can lay claim to the earliest invention ἓ This, however,
is a question of mere curiosity, rather than of use,
and I shall hence dwell upon it as briefly as possible.
It is asserted by many, who by no means contend for
the miraculous communication of literal characters by
the Supreme Being‚ that the antediluvians were in
possession ofsuch elements; and Josephus advances so
far as to say, that remains of such characters were to
be seen, in his own aera, through different parts of
Syria, engraveu upon smue-pstlars, the workmanship
also of autediluvian ages. Antiq. i. z. It is an as-
sei-tion, however, which wants much confirmation,
and is exposed to many doubts. It is, nevertheless’
probable‚ that a people who had made such progress
in the science of practical navigation, as to be able to
bnild an ark, had made some progress also in the sci·
enee of written or symbolic language. Yet the sacred
Scriptnres are totally silent upon the subject3 and
whether this be, or be not a fact, as also whether, if
it be, the scient-es were, or were not lost, by the cai·-

lier descendants of Noah, we are hence left at full li-
berty to conjecture f0r ourselves. Certain it is, that
no antediluvian documents have either descended
to ourselves‚ or are so clearly designated in the
writings of any remote age which have reached us,
as to enable us to form ajudgment upon this subject.
The chief rivals for the honour of having first in-
vented letters, are the Egyptians, Phoenicius, Chal-
deans, Syrians, Arabians, and lndians; and, among
these, the best claim seems to be established by the
Phoenicians. The ancient Hebrew or Samaritam how-
ever, are the same, or nearly so, as the old Phoenician
characters, and probably gave birth to them ς and the
Chaldaic‚ in which a part of the Jewish seriptures ia

written, are unquestionably derived from the Samari- ·

tans :—this exchange in the alphabeta of the Old
Testament, from the old Hebrew οι·ι Samaritan to the
Chaldaic‚ is supposed to have been introduced by the
prophet Ezra. It is highly probable, both from
tradition, and the coincidence of genuine history,
that the Egyptians derived their knowledge of letters
from the chaldeam, and perhaps about the period of
Abraham, by whom Josephus expressly declares that
they were instructed in this science ; though it is also
contended by the two Egyptian historians Sanchonia-
tho and Manetho‚ that they derived it immediately
from Phoenicia, through the instruction-of Tam, the
son of Mem, or Misor, the Misraim of holy writ,
who was of Phoenician birth, being the second son of
Amyn, or Ham, and who seated himself at Zoar, to-
wards the entrance of Egypt, in the year before Christ
two thousand one hundred and twenty-eight. He
built Thebes, and, according to some reporta,
Memphis: is denominated by Herodotus and Dio-
dorous Siculus, Eratosthenes, and, by Eusebius, Afri-
canus. Allowing this Taut‚ or Hermes, tohave in-
troduced his characters, even not till ten years after
the conimencement of his father‘s reign, although he
