Boox IV. THE NATURE OF THINGS. 41

Thus heat exhales, cold, dewy damp from streams,

And the rough spray from ocean, with fierce fang 22 5
Gnawing the mound that dares resist its waves.

Thus sounds, too, hover in the breezy air3

And, when the beach we traverse‚ oft the tongue

Smarts with the briny vapour t or if chance,

By dextrous leech, fell wormwood near be bruis'd‚ 2 ,

'We taste th' essential bitter‚ and abhor.
Thus some light effluence streams from all create,
Streams forth for ever, void of dull repose,
Towards every point diffus'd: for man perceives
Where’er his station, sight alike exists‚ 2 3 5
The sense of fluent odours, and of sounds,
And as, moreo’er, th’ essaying hand decides
Oft in the dark an object as precise
As the keen eye at mid-day‚-—hence we deem
Touch and the sight by equal causes sway’d. 240
Thus, if a cube we handle, and, at night,
Its shape assure uS, what but the mere shape
