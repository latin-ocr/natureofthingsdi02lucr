ssoox IV. THE NATURE OF THINGS.

With perfect semblance. W hence this semblance fair
But from supernal images expell'd?

These, as more gross, we mark ; yet why the gross
should rather thus exfoliate than the flake

Of subtler texture, reason ne'er can prove.

Hence effigies there are from all things pour’d

Of nice resemblance, and the fairest web ;

Which, though, when single, from the sight conceasd,
When close reflected in perpetual stream

From the clear mirror, obvious meet the view.
Nor can the sophist other cause adduce

&Vhence springs the picture so correctly just.

Come, now, and mark with what attenuate frame
Such pictures live. This the prime seeds of things
So fugitive to sense, so less than aught

The keenest sight can pierce, perchance may prove.

How subtle these, then, thus the muse explains,

F irst, there are insects so minute, the view
Not half their puny members can discern.
What here are organs? what intestines here?

The globnle what that forms their heart or eye?
