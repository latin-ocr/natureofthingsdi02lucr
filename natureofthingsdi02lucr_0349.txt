Still breaks, the grass—hopper his curious web,

And seeks, spontaneous, foods and vital air.

he soon abandoned the idea, and introduced a system
of his own ι a system, however, in many respects less
commodious, and with which Linneus himself never
appears to have been satisfied. To Block and Lace*-
pede we are chiefly indebted for gener-ic classifications
and descriptione of fishes, and to Dr. Munro and
professor Camper, for the little knowledge we yet
possess of their physiology and anatomy. It was this
last naturalist who first detected the organ of hear·
ing in this class of animab, who were, till this dis-
covery, supposed to be both perfectly mute and per.
fectly dumb, neither of which, however, is altogether
true. Camper first published an anatomical descrip-
tion of this organ in 1761 ;—he still pursued the in-
quii-53 and in 1767, made it the subject of a memoir,
addressed to the Royal Academy ; to which learned
body he addressed another memoir in ¹774, contain-
ing a still more particular account of the organ of

Ferrea progenies duris caput extulit arsis,

Imrnissaeque ferae sylvis, et sidera coelo.

Yes! lovely Sume! when rose the world to
birth,

Thy genial radiance dawn’d upon the earth ,

Beneath thy balmy air creation grew,

And no black gale on infant nature hlcw.

When herda first drank the light, srom eartlu's

When first man’s iron race uprcar'd its head,

When first to beasts the wild and wood were

given,
And stars unnumber’d pav’d th' expanse of

heaven.

and mandrbles. This discovery has been occasionally

attributed to our own ingenious countryman ΜΓ. J. ’

Hunter, who was certainly engaged about the same
time in the same pursuit: but the detection of this cu-
rious fact, in point of priority of time, is unquestiou-

ably due to M. Camper.

The parallel description of virgil is so extremely op-
portune, and at the same time so intrinsically beauti-
ful, that it would be* unpardouablc to omit it in the
present place :
