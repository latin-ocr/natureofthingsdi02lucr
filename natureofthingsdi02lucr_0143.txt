Boon IV. THE NATURE OF TIIINGS. 129

The craving hunger that subdues thc soul.

So, too, the goblet spreads its liquid stores

NVhere’er those stores are sougffl, with grateful draught 890
Quenching the fiery stomach, and absorb'd

Through all the members, fresh'ning as it flows.

Hence dies the raging hunger3 and the thirst,

Panting no more, is drown'd in fluent bliss.

Now next unfold we, thou the docmne mark, 895
lIow the firm foot advances at our will?
Whence draw the limbs their motion? and within
KVhat this strange power the body’s bulk that drives ἒ-

First‚ then, we hold—-a precept urg’d before—
T hat the light images that rove around 900
Beset‚ and' strike the mind3 hence springs the will
Determin’d instant3 for no mortal aught
Can e’er commence but what th' interior mind
wius, and decides3 and what the mind thus wills
Th' assailing image governs by its form. 005

O'er all the system, the commotion fclt
