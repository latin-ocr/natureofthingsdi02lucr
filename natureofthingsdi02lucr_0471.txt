Boon VI. THE NATURE OF THINGS.

But the blue lightning springs from seeds of fire
With seeds conflicting mid the war of clouds.
As when the flinti with flint, or steel, contends, 16 5
Swift flows the flash, and sparkles all around.
Then earlier see we, too, the rushing blaze
Thau hear the mar, since far the fluent filins
Of sight move speedier than of laggard sound.
As, when the woodman fells some branch remote, 1 70

Strike on the ear--so the keen lightning far

Anticipates the thunder, though alike

Breake swiftly forth, and wakes the sleepy night;

 

these a third solution is added, to wit, that oeca-
eionally the pent-up and clastic air may, from its in-

creased rarefaction, extrude a vast multitude of these
igneoue and attenuate particles through the pores
of the cloudy film, without breaking its texture:
while, at other times, this texture may be so ex-
tremely abraded, beneath the repercussion of a vio-
lent whirlwind, aa to be completely worn through,
and thus compelled to scatter the combined etherial

fire that exists in its interior. In these various cx.
planationa of the phaenomenon of lightning, as in his
explanatione of the celestial sphere, our poet advanccs
the beat supported opinions of his own aera, without
strenuoualy opposing, or contending for one rather
than another.
