THE NATURE OF THINGS.

O'erthrows all human greatness! treads to dust

Rods‚ ensignS‚ crowns—the proudest pomps of state,

And laughs at all the mockery of man !

When, t00, the total earth beneath us quakes,

And tott'ring towns loud tumble, or so threat,

What wonder men their littleness should feel,

And to the gods all power and might ascribe,

VVhence rule they, ceaseless, this stupendous world?

This clear discuss'd, leam next that silves, gold,

Lead, hardier copper, iron, first were trac'd

XVhem o’er the hius, some conflagration dire

Burn’d from its basis the deep-rooted gr0ve3

By lightnings haply kindled‚ or the craft

Of hosts contending o'er the woodland sceneS,

Had wasted woods on mountain, oe in vale,

Down to the veins os earth, thence gliding hot
To some cave’smouth, or whether washed by stream
From underground) the iiquid ore he drain'd

Into fit moulds prepar’d. Pu. Los·i·, xi. 564.
