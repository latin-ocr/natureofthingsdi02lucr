DE RERUM NATURA.

Lus. IV.

Et vitulei‚ quom membranas de corpore summo

Nascentes mittunt3 et item quom lubrica serpens

Exuit in spinis vestem3 nam saepe videmus

Illorum spoliis vepreis volitantibus auctas.

60

Quae quoniam fiunt, tenuis quoque debet imago

Ab rebus mitti, summo de corpore rerum.

Nam, quur illa cadant magis,

ab rebusque recedant,

Quam quae tenuia sunt, hiscundi est nulla potesta53

Praesertim, quom sint in summis corpora rebus

 

scldom to be questioned: no philosopher appears
<ver to have studied nature with a more enlarged or
attentive eye than himself3 and the very beautiful
simile before us is a pxoof of the truth of this asser<
tion. The cicada or grass-hoppen like all the other
species of the gryllus, though existing but for a
single season, being hatched iu the spring, and
dying at the close of the summer, immediately aster
the period in which the female has deposited her
egge, casts its skin in the same manner as the cater-
pillar, and deposits in the fields a membr-ane so
accurately true to its entire shape‚ that it is often
mistaken at first sight for the grass-hoppcr itsclf.
Several of the translators of our poet have ignorautly
questioned the fact here advanced: but they hence
only prove themselves unworthy os commenting up-
on the natural history of the Roman bard. Mr.
Wakefield has well observed, that the complexion
of the whole passage sufficiently indicates, that his
mind was impressed with Aristotle's description of
the same fact. He is speaking of the snake: εκδυε-
ται *γαρ ὦ,- :rep τοι εμῗρυκ εκ των >copim—Er 3⁶ *rer-ruys,—
περιρραγεγτος του κελυφους, εξὲρχονταιιτ “it throws off
its cuticle, as the fetus at its birth throws off the
membr-ane that surrouuds itz—the grass-hopper in
like manner disengages itself from its involvirig tu-
nic.’' See note on b. iii. 626. of this poem, where
several of these phaenomena have been already noticed.

Perhaps, of au the animal exfoliations we meet

with, the silk-worm exhibits the most extr-nordi-
nary. In less than thirty days from the hour of
its being hatchcd, it casts its skin four times ; about

the loth, ioth, 21st, and 27th day: and some days
before the last change takes place, which metamor-
phoses it into an aurelia. it voids, with its excre-
ment, the very tube which lines the inside of its
stozitach and intestines. The exsoliatcd pellicle re-
tains so entirely the figure of the calci-pillar in its
head, tecth, legs, colour, and bair, that, like the
cast-off membrane of the grass-hoppen it is also
osten mistaken for the insect itse-lf. The other spc-
cics of camrpillms, with which wc are acquainttd,
discharge their cuticlcs only twice οι· thrice, while
in their worm-stage of existence.

The cicada, or grass-hoppen is said by some Ita-
lian writers, to possess a loud and shrill accent du·
ring the intensity of summer. Thus Sanazaro: “ Per
gli ombrosi rami le argute cicale cantando si affatica
vano sotto al gran cald0.'' And hence Virgil, who

had probably been a witness, in the same country, to
the same fact z

Et cantu querulae‘rumpent arbusta cicadae.
Gsoac. iii.
And the loud woods with shrill cicadas ring.
So-ruzme.

The ode xliii. of Anacreon is entirely devoted to
the melodious chirping of this inseet ; and, in the
