Praeterea, magnii ex parte mare montis ad ejus

Radices frangit fluctus, aestumque resolvit.

Ex hoc usque mare speluncae montis ad altas

Perveniunt subter fauces : hac ire, fatendum est,

Et penetrare, mari, penitus res cogit, aperto,

Atque ecflarc foras; ideoque extollere flammas,

Saxaque subjectare, et arenae tollere nimbos.

AEtna and Vesuvius probably existed as mountains, ex-
cavated, and extending their subterraneous galleries to
the sca, prior to their conversion into volcanos.
'With respect to Vesuvius, the number of Neptunian
stones it throws up, of which some account may be

 

seen in Gioeni’s Lithography, confir-ms this opinion ς
and as to AEtna, Mr. Kirwan has accurately observed,
that there can be no doubt upon the subject. “ Do-
lomicu,'' says he, Geological Essay, p. 103, “ found
immense heaps of sea-shells in its north-east flanks,
at the height of near 2000 feet over the surface of the
sea.” Hence, he just'ly concludes, ‘¹ that this volcano
existed as a mountain before it was uncovered by the
sea :’' and adds, ‘⁴ that, at the height of about 2400
feet, there are regular strata of grey clay, filled with
marine shells: these strata must theu have been de-
posited while the mountain was forming underthe sea.’'
ln addition to which, I may obser-ee that, even in mo-
dern times, volcanic lava has frequently been found in

the sea towards the roots of this mountain. The island

of Goza, near Malta, unquestionably of volcanic origin,
is well known to be so considerably excavated by the
Mediterranean, as to have a variety of jets-d’eaux of
salt-water speuting up through its surface ς and the
ascending stream, when it has once found a spiracle,
rushes often with such violence as to drive back the
heavy stenes, and other matters with which the inha-
bitants occasionally attempt to block up the pas-
sage. See M. Boi=gelin‘s Ancient and Modern
Malta, 3 vols. 4to. 1804. Some such communica-
tion between AEtna and the adjacent sea is conjec-
tured by our poet, and perhaps actually exists.
