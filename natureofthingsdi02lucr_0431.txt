Boox' V. THE NATURE OF THINGS. 417

Near gliding streams‚ by shadowy trees o'er—arch'd, 14 30
And void of costly wealth found still the means

To gladden life. But chief when genial spring

Led forth her laughing train, and the young year

Painted the meads with roseat {lowers profuse—

Then mirth, and wit, and wilm, and fmlic, chief, 143 5
Flow’d from the heart3 for then the rustic muse

Warmest inspir’d them: then lascivious sport

Taught round their heads‚ their shoulders, taught to twine
Foliage‚ and flowerS, and garlands richly dight ;

To loose‚ innum’rous time their limbs to move, 1440
And beat, with sturdy foot, maternal earth ;

While many a smile, and many a laughter loud,

Told all was new, and wond'rous much esteem'd.

Thus wakeful liv'd they, cheating of its rest

The drowsy midnight ; with the jocund dance 1445

Mixing gay converse, madrigals, and strains
