THE NATURE OF THINGS.

Transported most, the race produc'd will, then,

From female stores prove female, if revers'd‚

From stores paternal, male.

But when the form

Blends both its parents’ features it ascends

From equal powers of each ; the warm embraee

Rousing alike, through each conflicting frume,

The seeds of latent life in scale so nice

and Needham, in an admirable paper inserted in the
Philosophieal Transactions, vol. xiv. In each of
' these last publicatione, indeed, we find some degree
of change, andsfot the most part, some degree of
improvement ;but the variations are neither numerous
nor very essential. Haller and Bonnet have endea-
voured to revive the theory of female generative
power alone, as first established by Har-vey3 or ra·
ther to erect an edifice somewhat similar to it from
the crumbling ruins of the ancient building; and
they have appealed to the phaenomena of the vegeta-
ble creation with considerable research, and some de-
gree of success: but this system, nevertheless, never
has been vcry⁵generally followed ; and is now almost
relinquished‚ even in Ger-many.

The system of Darwin differs but little from that
of Buffon, and obviously took its rise from the lat-
ter ; of course it does not vary considerably from the
theory of Lucretius. We here meet with seereted
and superabundant gemis, which are not only orga-
nie, but positively declared to be vital; and this,
whether they be secreted in a vegetable or in an ani-
mal frume, for the eystems of Buffon and Darwin ex·
tend to each nlike ς but by vitality, the latter informs
us. he intends ‘⁴ some degree oforganization, or other
proper-ties not existing in inanimate matter :’' so
that they neem prccisely to corre-spond with the or-
. ganic get-ms or rnolecules of the former. The term
rnoleenle, however, in the language of Darwin, is
only applied to the female department : the germs or
pm‘ticles secreta-d by the feminine organs of a bud or
a flower, or the feminine organa os an animal, are de.

nominated molecules with formative propensities:
while those secreted from the masculine organs of ei-
ther department are entitlcd fihrils with formative
appetencies. To establish the propriety of such a
distinction, he conceives that the latter possess a
greater degree of organization than the former: but
this, even upon his own system, is total conjecture, nor
is any one fact adverted to for the support of such a
belief. Both, however, we are told, have an appe-
teney or propensior) to form or create, and “they
reciprocally stimulate and embrace each other, and
instantly coalesce ; and may thus popularly be corn-
pared, observes the ingenious theorist, to the double
affinities of chemistry.¹' The fctus, whether vege-
table' or animal, whether oviparous or viviparous. is
the consequence of this formative effort on both sides.
Phytologia, part i. sect. 7. Professor Blumcubaeli
of Gottingen, lias also of late brought fortivards a
theory, ns Ι have remarked in another place, (sec
Note ou Book V. 436.) not css-entially different from
this uf Dr. Dar-win: lie supposes every particle of
nnorgnnizcd mutter to be endued with a cremive or
formative power, und every particle of organized
matter with a creative or formative eison, (lisllungs.
trieb‚) :r principle similar in many respecta to that of
gravitation. From the first he traces the rude origin
of the world and the minei-al kingdom: from tlrc
last, the rise os vegetables and arnrnarls.
