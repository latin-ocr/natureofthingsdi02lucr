a large portion of this substance, and when deprived
of it they lose their flexibility, and become rigid.
Feathers and quills possess little or no gelatin:
they are probably elongatione, and modifications of
the cuticle alone. The horny crusts of insects‚ the
scales of the scorpion, tortoise-shell, human nail,
and the paring of the ox’s hoof, are of the same
kind: alumine of eggs, when coagulated and daed,
resembles tortoise-shell, or human nail. With respect
to the muscular fibre, Mr. Hatchett concludes, from
his experiments on this subject, that it “ contains
lime in various proportions, and in two different
states, viz. carbonat and phosphat3 and that the
greater part of the latter is gradually separated in
conjunction with thc gelatin‚ by means of boiling
“ Ι would not have it understood, how-
ever,” continues he, “that phosphat of lime is an

water.’ '

essential ingredient in gelatinous substances ς sor, on
the contrary, isinglass, which is a persecly gelatinous
body, affords but a merc visible trace of it. The
muscular fibre contains therefore, occasionally, the
basis of both bone and shell. The distinguishing
chemical character of the latter being carbonat of
lime, and that of the former, as well as of the ena-
mel of the teeth, being phosphat of lime: in the
formation of bone, however, a certain proper-tion of
carbonat is a constituent part, or at least generally
enters into its composition.'’ See Note on Book

spect to gelatin‚ Mr. Hatchett has thrown out an xn-
genious hint, that as the putrescibility as well as the
flexibility and clasticity of bodies depends upon thc
proportion they possess of this substance, and as at:-
tiseptics generally contain the tanning principle,
which is well known to produce its peculiar effects
by precipitating the gelatio, the tonic effects of the
Peruvian bark may depend on its tanniu, which is
again a very different principle from that of its as-
tringency. The willow-bark, which also contains the
tanniu, and is not peculiarly astringent, is a tonic; and
the cinchona floribunda, which does not contain the
tanniu, is reported to be inert as to medical qualities.

and durable dyc obtained from this valuable shell-
fish of the Old world, is known by history to every
one. A full account of it, however, ιο those who
arc desii-ons of rnore explicit information, may be ob-

 

tained by consulting Pliny, ix. 38. who intimatas
that, either from a variety in the fish employed,
or in the mode of manufacturing the colour, it
occasionally exhibited a considerable differente-.- of
tincture, and hence was denominated rose-purple,
violet-purple, hyacinth-purple. 'l'hc [ιι-η appears to
