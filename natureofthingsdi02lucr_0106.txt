DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. lv.

N unc aliis alius qui sit cibus, ut videamus,

Expediam3 qu& reve, aliis quod triste et amarum est,

Hoc tamen esse aliis possit perdulce videri:

Tantaque in hiis rebus distantia differitasque est,

Ut, quod aliis cibus est, aliis fuat acre venenum.

Est itaque, ut serpens, hominis quae tacta salivis,

Disperst, ac sese mandundo conficit ipsa.

Praeterea, nobis veratrum est acre venenum3

Ver. 63 3.

 

what polscns this

‘To that proves healthsul. aml prolongales Iifa]
This assei-tion is true to an adage; and it has of late
been accurately ascertained‚ that the indisposition
which frequently succeeds a meal made upon muscles,
or other shell-fishes, has, in many instanccs, procceded
from their having sed in a stream so strongly im-
pregnated with copper, as to give evident marks of
its, existence in the fluid found in their stomaehs:
and yut the mineral which, when diluted with other
food, thus proves a poison to mankind, produces no
iujury to the shell-fish which partakes of it in a state
of sai· higher conccutration, and foi· any thing we
know to the contrary, may contnin a substance
capable of futteniug it. In the same manner, al·
though about three grains of the venom of :³ viper,
dismived in water, be calculated by Spalanzani tu be
sufficient to destroy a man in full benith, the Psylli
of Egypt are reported hy the most authentia: travel-
lcrs through this country, to be able to eat the whole
animal alive, begirning at the head, and of course de-
vouring the entire cyot of secreted poison, without
the smallest degree of barm. See, on this subject,
the treatises of Redi and fontana. The diet of the
viper, which is a mixture of the common vegetables
and insects of the fields, we know, morecver, to be
not in itself poisonous; and yet here is a poison
secretcd from healthy sood: while, on the contrary,
there :ire a variety of insccts and animalcula residing

 

in the neighbourhood, and even in the concavities of
lead and copper mines, which seem to be supported
almost entirely by their ore and effluvium, digesting
them with the most perfect safety, and deriving from
them a healthy nutrimen, hereby demonstrating,
that they possess a strictly chemical power of decom-
pounding the particles of which such minerals con-
sist‚ of destroying their deleterious property, and of

recomhining them into a nutritive substance. See
Note on ver. 657. of this Book.

Ver. 655. ‘Thus dits the snake that human spitde
testea] Such, at least, was the universal opi-

nion from the aera of Aristotle to that of Pliny ς both
of whom assert the same fact. Gzzlen also contenda
for its tuith, but confines the saliva to that secreted
in the morning before the fast is broken. Many of
the most celebrated Italian naturalists, however, and
particularly Redi and Spalanzani, who have made a
variety os experiments for thie express purpose, main-
tain that al} such assertions are evonenus, and that
no sensible change is produced upon either snake or

viper by such a deglutition. It is not improbable,
however, that Lucretius may still be right with re-

spect to some species not yet essayed 3 and his gene-
ral accuracy ought to induce our hesitation.
