THE NATURE OF THINGS.

It breaks innumerous, as sparks at night

To countless sparklings ; hence the scene throughout

O'erflows with sound, through every winding felt.

Yet visual image8‚ when once propell'd,

625

Rush but in lines direct3 whence none can see

Things pent above, ‚though voice th' enclosure pierce.

Yet voice itself, thus piercing, saints obtuse,

Heard indistinct, and rather sound than sense.

To TASTES proceed we ε whence the tongue's nice powers

Spring, and the Curious palate, full t' unfold.——-

Ver. 630. —whence the tongue’s m'ce powers
Spring, and the curious palate, sull t’ uqsold]
In the original thus, v. 619.

Hoc, qui sentimus sucum, lingua atque palatum
Plusculum habent in se rationis, plus opera'i‘.

The common principle of action being applied, it
nevertheless requires more labour to develope‚ and
more attention to discern, whence different sub-
·tanccs should possess such an infinite variety ofsupid
euences, and the organ of tat-,te be able to scrutinize
them with ιο much accuracy than was necessary in
discussing the less complex phaenomena of sound.
This our poet hints at in the verses now quoted, and

which arc properly translated both by Marchcni
and Des Cnuturea: thus the former:

Ma la lingua, e il palato, ove consiste
Del gusto il senso, han di ragione, e d'opra
Parte alquanto maggior.

And thus the Bai-on des Conturesz

Le gout cst lc bien-fait dc la langue et du puluis ς
Ιέκρὶίςτιιίοη de cet effet deliciunt, quoique plu· vrai-

semblable, eu heaut-nvp plus dfftile.

Our English translators, on the contrary, render
the passage, instead of “ more difficult‚’' “ quite as
easy.''

Thus Creech, hastening forwards with au his
might:

We triste (that‘s soon explained) when savours

wrung, Sec.

And Gucrnier thus, in simple prose .

“ Nor is the account of the tonguc and palate, by
which we taste, a subject of greater nicety or more
difficulty to explain.’'
contrary to the text which it pretends to interpret, a·

could well be offered.

Ῑ dwell on this circumstance, merely to prove how
carelessly :ind inaccurately‚ even in the minute-t mat-
ters, Lucretius has hitherto been presented to the

An assertion as completely

English render.

The doctrine here evinccd conecming taste, was
importcd by Epicurus from the earlier school of De—
mocritus ; for which we have the testimony of Theo-

phrastus, lib. vi. ιΔ
