Boon V. THE NATURE OF TIIINGS. 421

Their earliest wearer by the faithless crowd 1460
F ell, and the gad), ferocious fought for still,
Rent into tatters‚ perish’d void of use.
Then man for skins contended: purple now
And gold for ever plunge him into war3
Far slend'rer pretext! for, such skins without, 1465
The naked throngs had dreaded every blast:
But us no ills can menace, though depriv’d
Of purple woof brocacled stiff with gold,
While humbler vests still proffer their defence.
Yet vainly, vainly toil earth’s restless tribes, 1470
With fruitless cares corroding every h0ur3
Untaught the lust of wishing where to bound,
And where true pleasure ceases; rend'ring time
One joyless main, where sail they, void of helm,
Courting for ever tumults‚ storms‚ and strife. 1475
But, through the heavens, the wakeful sun and moon
Driving, meanwhile, their radiant cars sublime,

Taught first to mortals how the seasons roll’d,
