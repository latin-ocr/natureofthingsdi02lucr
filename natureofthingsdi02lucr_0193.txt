THE NATURE OF THINGS.

Keen remorse

179

1175

Goads him, perchmce, for dissipated time,
And months on months destroy'd ; or from the sair
Haply some phrase of doubtful import darts,

Their, like a living coal, his beart corrodes:

Or oft her eyes wide wander‚ as he deemS,

1180

And sce-k some happier rival, while the smile
Of smother'd love half dimples o'er her cheeks.

Such are the ills that on amours attend

Most blest and prosperous3 but on those adverse

Throng myriads daily, obvious and more keen.

1185

Hence, by the muse forewarn’d, with studi0us heed

A wound within he bears, a grievous smart,
For through his liver Love has struck his dart.

So, Horace τ

Cum tibi flagrans amor, et libido
Saeviet circa Jecur( ulcerosum.

On. l. i. 25.

When raging love, and sterce desire
Shall all thiue ulcer’d livet· fire.

Ver. 1179. Thm, lii-e a living roal, his henr! cor-
rodes :] In the similar description of Solomon
wc again tracc the same metaphor:

Can a man sni-round hix bosom <with-stre,

And his ctoaths not bc bur-nt ?

Can n man troad upon live touls,

And hia fect not bc corrodcd?

Puov. vi. λγ, ιδ’.

This imngery of the Hebrew moralist refers, how.
ever, as directly to the future as the present affe-ets
of i'hcit love. ‘⁴ Can a man thus burn with a lawless
passion, and his same. his sonunt, his reputation,
whatever surrounds his person, be not hereby totally
tonsunml. and himself become naknl. nccdy, and
dupin-d ἰ Can a man mad on live eonls, and not cx-

hibit the selon marks of convicte who have been sext-
tenced to such a punishment? Must not his guilt be
rendered obvious, and his company be avoided by
every one ?” Upon this point our own poet has alrea-
dy touched, vcr. 1¹55·

“ Then, too, his form consumes, &c.''

The Helu-ew term ΠΠΠ, which I have above
rendered surromled, is not done justice to in our
common version : “ Can a man tal-e fire, δίς. ?'' It
convcys a much more definite and impressive idea,
aud means either to implicate or hleml together ; or else,
to marginem, or emir-cle with a bot-der. The Ambi-
ans, who have also borrowed this term from the
Heba-ivs, still retain it in both scnses, and in two
dIffcrctxt forms: Π), and QX> · The English vcr.
sion is adopted from Pag'hinus: ‘⁴ numquid (rc-ipis!
vir iguem, ἃς. ?''

Nothing can be more obvious than the meaning os

our poet, which ii sully interpated, 'tf Ι mistakc

not, in the version before us:
