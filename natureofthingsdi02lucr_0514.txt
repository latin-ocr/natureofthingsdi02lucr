DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. VI.

Et, quasi densendo, subtexit caerula nimbis.

Fit quoque, ut hunc veniant in coetum &trinsecus illi

Corpora, quae faciunt nubeis, nimbosque volanteis.

Innumerabilem enim numerum, summamque profundi

Esse infinitam docui; quantaque volarent

485

Corpora mobilitate, obstendi‚ quamque repente

Innumerabile per spatium transire solerent:

Haud igitur mirum est, si parvo tempore saepe

Tan] lnagnOS montelS tempestaS 21th6 tenebl‘ae

Cooperiant maria, ac terraS‚ inpensa superne :

Undique quandoquidem, per caulas aetheris omneis,

Et quasi per magni circum spiracula mundi,

Exitus introitusque elementis redditus exstat.

Nunc age, quo pacto pluvius concrescat in altis

Nubibus humor, et in terras dimissus, ut imber,

Decidat, expediam.

495

Primum, jam semina aqua'i'

Multa simul vincam consurgere nubibus ipsis

Omnibus ex rebus; pariterque ita crescere utrumque,

supposes, to be occasionally attested in their ssight,

os rushing ether : that is to say, of that volatile, and
highly spirited fluid which, asceuding from the body of
the earth, rises into the sublimest pai-ts of the atmo-

sphere,and was supposed by many ancient philosophers
xo afford nutriment to the sun and star-s. The particles

of this, as well as those of the still more attenuate
stream of primordial atoms, which are for ever flying
in all directions through the immensity of space, to re-
cruit the different systems of worlds beyond worlds, to

which our poet immediately afterwards adverts-he

and to contribute to the formation of clouds, in the

same manner as the grosser fluids of aqueous exhala-
tion and vapour.
