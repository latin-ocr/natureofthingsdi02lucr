Boox VI. THE NATURE OF TIIINGS.

How flows the fiery deluge when enrag’d.

And, first, the mighty mount is scoop’d throughout,

High arch’d with sparry columns τ winds and airs
Fill all its caveS‚ for agitated air

To wind convertS, resistless in its might.

This, when once heated, and its torrid breath
Has heated, too, the mingled mass around

Of rocks, and earths sulphureous, and a flood

Of frantie flame engender’d——bursts abrupr‚

And, through the mountain's monster-jaws, ejects
Tow'rds every point its embers, and its blaze ;
Belches whole atmospheres of smoke‚ and high
Hurls from its base huge crags of weight immense.

To air incens’d such wonder& all, resolve.

It· is difficule for two pects, when describing the
same subject, to avoid all similariry of ter-ms and co-
louring. But there is more, I think, than an :icci- down:
‹lental resemblance to the present delineation of Lu-
cretius in Virgil's history of the same phoeuomcnon,
which is as follows, AEtna being here also the moun-

tain referred to :

Interdumque atram prorumpit ad :ethera nubem,
Turbine fumantem picco et candente sax-ills· ι high
Attollitque globos flAmmarum, ct sidera lambit ι

Interdum scopulos avulsaque viscera montis

Ost, liquid lakes uf buruing sulphur stow,
ch from the ficry springs that buil below.
