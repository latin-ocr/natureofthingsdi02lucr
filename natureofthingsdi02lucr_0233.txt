THE NATURE OF TIMNGS.

A god, illustrious ΜΕΜΜιυε 1 he who first

The rules of life devis’d, now term’d by all,

Sole, solid VV18D0M3 he whose happy art v

From such wild waves such shades of ten-fold night,

Leads us to truth, tranquillity, and day.

What are to him the gods of earlier times ? ι

CERES, who taught the fruits of earth to rear,

As fame reports? or BACCHUS, first who stole

Plato, it was with but an ill grace that he opposed
the disciples os Epicurus in their application os it to
the founder of their own sect. Itis truly astonish-
ing, therefore, to see almost all the commentator-s
and translators of Epicurus ofa later date, still ap-
plying this false interpretation of Cicero to the pas-
sage before ns; and maintaining, in consequence,
that Lucretius is here contending for the deification
of the Grecian philosopher. Des Coutures has car-
ried this idea, in his translation, to the most extrava-
gant height: “ such 3 man must have been a god,'’
says he; “ yes 1 without doubt, Memmius, his birth
must have been divine ;’'-—and ver. 52. “ assuredly,
we are called upon in common gratitude to erect to
him temples and altars.'' In the original, however,
we meet with neither divine birth, imples, nor altars.
“ ll faut dire que cc grand homme sut un Dicu.
Oui sans doute, Memmius, sa naissanccsut divine.—
Celui merite assure'ment qne notre reeonnoizsance lui
dresse des temples et des autels.” If Lucretius, how-
ever, have sinned, he has only sinned, as 1 have bc-
fore observed, with the sacred writers. The holy term
eloim,the divinitypluralized‚ is applied to Moses by the
Almiglity himself, Exod. vii. 1. “Bt-hold, I 113ν1ς11111111.ι
thee a g⁰‹l(·.·1'7&) to Ρ”1131·ο311.” It is applied, 111 like
manner, to 3 messcngcr from the Deity, in Judges
xiii. 22. and even to the goldcn calf, by Aaron him-
self, which is denominated, still plurally. :lfl's ῚΠῌΝ
(gods of gold). Ῑ11 like manner, in modern times,
the pions and excellent Tillotson ι “ To be charita-
hle, and helpsul, 111111 beneficiul to others, is to bc ³¹

good Arcem, and 3 saviouk, and a conto men.’'
Sermon on Acts x. 38.

So Tliomson, speaking in reference to the philoso-
phers of former periods generally :

Sages of ancient time, as Gons revered,
As Gons beneficent, who bless'd mankind
With arts and arms, and humaniz’d a world.

to the same tradition :
