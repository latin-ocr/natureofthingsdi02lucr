Boon VI. THE NATURE OF THINGS. ᾖ 569

Some wood‚ some gold, some silver, crystal some,

Heat those pervading‚ the light image this. 1025
And thus through all things different objects rush

With ease far different ; nature to their forms,

Their powers diverse, as long anterior prov’d‚

Th’ appropriate duct adapting most exact.

These axioms thus premis’d, then, and maintain'd‚ 1030
All else flows obvious, and the total cause

Unfolds spontaneous that the steel compels.

First‚ from the magnet countless atoms stream
In tide perpetual, chacing the mid air
'Twixt the stern iron plac'd‚ and stone itself. 103 5
This space once emptied, and a total void
Form'd broad between, abrupt the seeds of steel‚
T hrown forth alike, usurp it, close conjoin'd,
Dragging the ring resistless as they rusb.
For nought exists with primal seeds more harsd, 1040

More clinch'd‚ more tangled in commumal bonds
