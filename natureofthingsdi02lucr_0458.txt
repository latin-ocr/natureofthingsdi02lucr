In menteis hominum divinae nuntia formae,

Subscipere hcec animi tranquilla pace valebis.

Inde videre licet, qualis jam vita sequatur3

Quam quidem ut a nobis ratio verissima longe

Rejiciat, quamquam sunt a me multa profecta,

Multa tamen restant, et sunt ornanda politis,

Versibu53 et ratio superum, coelique, tenenda;

Sunt tempestates, et fulmina clara canenda ;

Quid faciant, et qu& de caussa ququue ferantur 3,

Ne trepideS, coeli divisis partibus amens,

Unde volans ignis pervenerit, aut in utram se

The sacred sembltmces their forms emin] Thus
Thomson again:
Oh bear me to some vast embowering shades,

Plutarch, in his ‘⁶ Life of Pen'clesss‘ who, to his

It is against these popular prejudiceS, supersti-
