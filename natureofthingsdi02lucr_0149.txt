THE *NATURE oF 'fumos

This next the muse in melodies shall sing

More sweet than prolix3 as the swan’s lone dii-ge

perties of which are fully discussed by Lucretius in
Book Vl. v. 934. of the present Poeni—they should
never have been fortunate enough to have discovered
its vast utility in the scisne: of navigation-—nor hare
acquircd such a knowledge from the Oriental na-
tions, among some of whom, and particularly the
Chinesc‚ it has been immemorially appropriated to
this purpose.

Having thus cursorily glanced at a few of the me-
chanical powers of the ancients, which we seem to
have lost, 1 will just notice, before 1 close this note,
that wc seem also to have lost the art os making sc·-
veral of the cementa which, among the ancients‚
were applied to mechanical purposeS, and were of
immense use in all works of masonry-—uniting the
different bricks or stones of an editice with such a
pertinacity, that tbe substance of every brick or stone
would break before the cement would relinquish its
hold. Among the Babylonians, the more general cc-
ment employed appears to have been a composition of
lime and liquid bitumen : but as the Romans were in-
capable of obtaining the latter, in any large quantity,
without considerable trouble and expence, they were
obliged to invent a substitute for it, and they found a
very adequate one in oil. The peculiar mode, however,
by which they combined their lime and oil, we are
unacquainted with: but we know, from Vitruvius,
that with these materials, aud probably without the
mixture of any other, they made the stucco and ter-
iace mortar, with which they lined, externally‚ the
>ides and roofs of their houses, or united the stenes
or brie-ks with which they built them: and he re-
commends that to render the tenacity more perfect,
the walls and roofs bc moistened and saturated every
Autnmn with the lees of the olive, after its oil has
been preuscd out t ‘⁸ fracibus‚” says he, vii. i.
⁴· quotannis ante hiemem saturetur.'' In 1777. M.
de la Fuye publishcd, at Paris, a treatise upon this
subject, which hc entitlcd Recherches pour retrouver
la Pri-paratior} donne-c 32 la Chaux par les Romains;
and wc are told by M. Mongtz, (Mem. de l'Instit.
National Lit. ct Burnus-Arm, i.) that the architect

who repaired the walls of the cathedral at Par-is, in
the ensuing year, profited by this treatise, and united
his new mater-iah to the old by a cernent which, al-
though its preparation was kept a profound secret,
gave evident proofs of being a composition of lime
and oil. lt yet remains to be ascertained‚ however,
whether the mode of its preparation were similar to
that of the Romans, and whether it bc possessed of an
equal tenacity and durability. ¹ Probably, these im-
portant qualities might both be considerably aug-
mented, if to the lime or calx were added a certain
proportion of iron‘pyrite. Upon which subject, sev
the Note on BookVI.v. 1101. There are manyother in-
ventions ofthe Romansofvast utilityin the same scit-nce
ofbuilding, which we have equally lost, and of which a

short account may be found iu Pliny and Vitruvius.

Ver. 92 6. sofl sleep bedews the limbs,]

Thus Milton, employing the same metaphor :

 

 

the timely dew ofslcep
Now falling, with soft slumberous weight inclines
My eye-lids.

To the same effect, Valerius :

 

alta quies, liquidique potentia somni.
Aaoou. iv. 16.

The beart-felt ease, the power of liquidsk-fp.

But the rnost bold and animated use of this nieta-
phor of our poet, with which I am acquainted, is iu
the following verses comprising part of a very beauti-
ful eclogue of Garcilazo de la Vega ι

Y al que de pensamiento fatigado
El sueno batia con licor pfadoso
Curando el corazon despedazado.

Whom sleep mid many an anxious scheme,

Bulhes in his scs? and sooths'ng urtam,

And o'ei despair bids raptore bearn.

The version of Mare-hetti is highly elegant, and,
strictly true to the original :

 

il sonno per le membra irrighi
Lu εἰμι’-α quiete.
