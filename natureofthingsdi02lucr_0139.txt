Βοοκ 1V. THE NATURE OF THINGS. 125

Conscious of vision3 that the legs, the thighs 845
On the firm foot uprear'd their columnS, vers’d

Previous in paces 3 that the flexile arm

Hence nerv'd with strength its muscles; and the hands

Hung on each side, the messengers of life.

This, and whate'er such sophists else affirm 8 50
Is futile all, preposterous, and wild.

For nought so knows its office as to act

When first produc'd‚ but all produc'd alone

Learns it progressive. The nice power to see

Liv'd not before the eye—ba113 to debate 8 5 5
With graceful speech before the tongue was form’d,

The tongue long first created3 nor to hear

Ere rose the sense of sound3 nor aught besides

Of organ could anticipate its use.

Hence urg’d by use, no organ ever sprang. 860

wass, weadmit, with all their ills, began
And savage blows were dealt, and tides of blood

Flow’d forth obscene, ere yet the lucid spear

Was hurl’d indignant3 and to Hy its force

Preceded long the left hand's sturdy shield. 8 ὁ 5
