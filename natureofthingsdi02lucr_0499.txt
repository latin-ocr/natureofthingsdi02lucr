Boox VI. THE NATURE OF THINGS.

Where speeds its fury3 by what means empower’d

To pierce through walls, and then, triumphant, die;

Or what portends its brandish when display'd.

For if from Jovss, or Jovss's associateS, How

The roar tremendous, shatt’ring heaven's high arch;

If these, at will, the flaming bolt direct,—
Why 'scapes the guilty from its vengeful stroke,
Nor falls, transpiere'd‚ a monument to man ?
Or, rather, why, beneath the fiery storin,

Sinks he unconscious of committed crime,

Void of all blame, yet victim to its ire?

Why seek the gods, too, solitary scenes
And labour fruitless? need they, then, essay
Their wontless arm8‚ and nerve them for the sight?
Why thus their sire’s tremendous wrath exhaust
O'er the bare ground? or why himself permit,
Nor, for his foe5‚ the fiery bolt restrain Ρ
