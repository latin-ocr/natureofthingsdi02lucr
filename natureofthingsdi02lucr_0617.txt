THE NATURE OF THINGS.

0'03

By friends untended: nor was aught of cure

Discern'd specific3 for what here recall’d

1275

To day's bright regions the vanescent soul,

And gave the living ether to the lips,

Prov’d poison there, and ten-fold stamp'd the fate.

But this the direst horror, that when once

Μειη felt th' infection‚ as though full forewarn'd

1280

Of sure destruction, melancholy deep

Prey’d o'er his beart, h-is total courage fawel,

Death sole he look'd for, and his doom was death.

Thus seiz'd the dread, unmitigated *pest

Man after man, and day succeeding day,

1285

With taint voracious: like the herds they fell

At hand no snother: mid the healing tribe

Bursts the dire pest, their science now their bane.

While those more distentis, towards the sick who
prcss,

More certain perish : and, as hope subsides,

And towards the grave with surer step they tend,

Each wish they flattcr, hecdless what may har-m,

Or what may help them ,⁸ scr no heIp is the'irs.
