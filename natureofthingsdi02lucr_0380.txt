Plato after him, contended that speech was a sciente
determined upon, and inculcated in an early period
of the world by one, or, at least, by a few superior
persons acting in concert, and inducing the multi-
tude around them to adopt their vocal and arbitr-ary
signS. For it seems to have been generally agreed
upon by the different schools of philosophy, that on
the first orisjin

and that, according to the representation of Horace,

Of mim lallgllssge was ΠΟΥ. known:

Cum prorepserunt primis animalia terris,
Mutum et turpe pecus:

 

Donec verba, quibus voces sensusque notarent,
Nominaque invenere. sn. i. 3.
&Vhen first from earth tlie ranks of mortals burst,

A dumb, dull lierd :ippear'd they3 till at length

VVords they conceiv'd, and names by which to
mark
Their meanings, and ideas.

This opinion of Pythagoras and Plato our poet
justly conti-overts, by observing, that, without the
possession of speech, it would have been absolutely
impossible for any one man to have acquired a sys-

'tematic knowledge of vocal science: and even if he

could have done this, that it would have been equally
impossible to have communicated his ideas of this
science iu express lectures to the multitude. Our
poet accounts for the origin of systematic speech
much more philosophically, and perfectly in unison
with the modern theories of Buffon, lord Monboddo,
and Mr. H. Tooke. Animals of every class and
description, lie observes, have a natural language of
their own; or, in other words, they have a power
of expressing definite sensations by definite tenes:
mankind, therefore, on their earliest creation, must
have been possest of a species of natural language in
common with animals in general. Of what this lan-
guage consisted, it is idle to seek for explanation in
the present day ε like the natural language of all other
affirnals, it must, however, have been very confined,
very imperfect, and hence very much accompanied
and assisted by particular gesticulations. But formed
as man is, with organs of articulation better adapted
for vocal sounds than those of any other animal
