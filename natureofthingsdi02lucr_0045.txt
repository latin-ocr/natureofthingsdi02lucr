Boon lv. THE NATURE OF THINGS. ι 51:

Fleet they through ether, with elastic wing

Conqu'ring dull time, urg’d various to their goals.

This shall the muse in melodies evince 1 85
More sweet than prolix 3 as the swan’s lone dirge

Flows forth superior to the clam’rous croak

Of countless cranes, by every wind disperst.

Know, then, th’ attenuate substance must move quick3
But few th’ exceptionsi Hence the rapid race 190
Of light, and lustre from th’ effusive sun,

Since these, too, spring from atoms most minute,
With ease protruded‚ by posterior force
Urg'd on; for light for ever light succeed5‚

And floods of splendour floocls of splendour drive. 195

appears to have been a more favourite ornament
among the Spaninh barda, than among those of any
other country. lt is repeatedly adverted to by Gar-
cilaao de la Vega; and the gallant francisco de
Boi-ja offers us the following instance :

Aqui, dulce Senora,
Mi amarga muerte entre esta yerva verde
Cantando al alma llora,
Qal blanco eisne, que la vida pierde.

Here. lady fair ! in these green vales,
Aa the white swan when nature faile,
My apii-it chaunts with many a aigh
The bitter death l'm doom'd to dic.

lt is impossible to peu-use the latter part of oux
poet’s comparison. without being rcxnimltd os the
following verses of Homer:

iiiiv- περ namn γυμνιτ *uhu ουρανοθι τῃ

Vm„ ΙΙ.

As the mixt clangour ostninultuous cranes

That, mid descmiding irmts and rnshing mins,

Fly clam'rous o’er the deep.

The whole, however, appears tu hanc breti n pro-
verbial expression, as well among the Greeks as
the Romans, as we may conjecture from the follow-
ing distich of Antipater:
