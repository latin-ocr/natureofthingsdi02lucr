Drops, loosely drops the polish'd work she plies.

But endless are the substanees that, thus,

Melt all the members, and the soul subvert.

If long thou loiter in the public bath,

Or bathe at home o’erloaded with repast,

Wilt thou not faint, unsinew’d by the warmth ἓ

How much more elegantly is the languid hue of
the rose referred to in the following couplet of Gar-
cilaso de la Vega ε

Pale as the languid rose appears,
That art, before its season, rears.

Ver. 829. Or bathe at home o'erloadcd with repam]
The luxury of bathing was carried to the utmost ex·
cess among the Romans. Their public baths were
almost innumerable, and the more opulent had warm,
hot, and cold batha at their own houses. It was
customary with almost every one to bathe be-
fore eating ς but with the more voluptuous to bathe
afterwards aa well. The debility too frequently pro-
duced by thia latter practice is recorded in a variety
of places by Horace, Juvenal, and Persius.

Aa an example, I take the following verses srom
the last of thece poete :

Turgidus hic epulis, atque albo ventre lavatur,
Gutture sulphureas lente exhalante mephites ;
Sed tremor inter vina subic, cali ¹umque triental
Excutit e manibus ; dentes crepuere retecti ς
Uncta cadunt laxis tunc pulmentaria labris.

ὃΔτ. iii. 93.

Gorg'd with the feast, his lix-id paunch he laves ς
Foul, fetid vapours belching o'er the wares-
The glass still grasps he, but he grasps in vain,
His trembling hand o'crthrows the cordial ban< ;
His jaws, retracted‚ all his teeth disclosc,

And from his lips th' ejected banquet flou-s.
