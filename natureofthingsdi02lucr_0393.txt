BooK V. THE NATURE OF '1¹111NGS. 370

Heat oft by flame succeeded3 whence, perchance,

From both mankind their primal fires deduc'd. 1 120
But from the sun first learn'd they to prepare

The cultur'd meal hot-hissing o'er the hearth.

For all the plains produc'd the genial sun

They saw subjecting‚ by perpetual warmth

Matur'd, and sweeten'd: whence the wiser part 1 ι 2 5

First dar’d the change, and taught their wond'ring peers

The powers of coction, and the crackling blaze.
Those, too, elected rulers, now began

Towns to project‚ and raise the massy fort,

Heedful of distant dangers. Into shares 1 1 30

Their herds‚ and lands they sever'd3 and on those

Chief fam’d for beauty‚ eloquence, or strength,
Allotted ampler portioris: for the form

NIuch then avail'd‚ and much the potent arm.
But wealth ere long was fashion’(l‚ gold uprose‚ 1 13 ς
And half the power of strength, and beauty ssed.

And still the brave, the beanteons still, too ost,

And hence the declaration os Xenophon, (iu Spu- siam. uim ⁴m· xrs m· t ςἰ«,,.ιι.11κ fatuas-E . .- .,ἰ 1'*
