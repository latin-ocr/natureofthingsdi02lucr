THE NATURE OF THINGS.

233

By the chill air condens'd, to clouds concretes,

And with its filmy drap'ry veils the heavens.

So the light ether, as from every point

F luent it rose, concreted, and a bound

Gradual assum'd, and, thus assuming, grasp'd

In its vast compass all th’ evolving world.

Then mounted‚ next, the base of sun, and moon,

'Twixt earth and ether, in the midway air,

Rolling their orbs ; for into neither these

have continued long after the creation of animale
and vegetable3‚ and not indeed to have ceased alto-
gether, till within a few centuries before the deluge.
And he grounds this opinion upon the existence of

mountains hence termed secondary, which contain
marine sheHs, or other remains of animal or vegetable

substances between their strata, or incorporated in
the rocks of which they consist, and which must
have been formed before the sea had retreated far
from such elevations. He is also farther confirmed
in this belief from the discovery of trees of different
kinds, as well as of various other vegetables in great
depths within the range of our modern continents,
and even under lofty mountains3 as well as on the
summits of mountains at heights where, from the
degree of cold which at present prevails over them,
they could not grow. To these, he adds the exist-
ence of stratified mountains, between whose strata
various substances os marine and some terrestrial ve-
getables repose, either in their natural state, or pe-
trified: the regularity and uniformity of which de-
posit could have been effected by no other power,
that we are acquainted with, but successive and uni-
form tides.

An idea nearly similar occurs in ver. 331. of the pre-

490

sent Book: and thus Manilius, with elegant imiza-
tion :

Ipsa natat tellus, pelagi lustrata coroni
Cingentis medium liquidis amplexibus orbem.
iv. 593.
Earth swims herself, enfolded by the main,
Thac clasps her bosom in his liquid arms.

tem ofastronomy herc adverted to, the reader will find
some account in an ensuing Note of the Book before
us. I have already observed, that the universal flame
which necessarily ascended with the earliest exhala-
tion from the surfuce ofthc chaotic fluid, and which,
indeed, formed a part of th: atmosphcrc itself‚ upon
the theory ofthe present poem was attracted by the
sun, moon, and stass, and particularly by the first,
and compelle-d to convcrge and become coaevam-and
