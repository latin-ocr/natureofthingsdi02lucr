DE RERUM NATURA.

- Fit quoque, ut e mundi transvorsis partibus aer,

Alternis, certo fluere alter ternpore possit,

Qui queat aestivis lunam detrudere signis

Brumaleis usque ad flexus, gelidumque rigorem:

Et qui rejiciat gelidis ab frigoris umbris

AEstiferas usque in parteis, et fervida signa.

Et ratione pari solem stellasque putandum est,

Quae volvunt magnos iu magnis orbibus annos,

Aeribus posse, alternis, e partibus ire.

Nonne vides etiam divorsis nubila ventis

645

Divorsas ire in parteis, inferna supernis ?

The poet is herc exhibiting the opinion of Anaxime-

τα αστρα. This opinion is obviously founded upon
the supposition of monsoons existing in the higher
regions of the atmosphere, of equal permanence and
regularity with those traced by modern navigators in
different parts of the Atlantic and Paeific oceans.
See Note on ver. 661. of the present Book.

Ver. 654. This the moon driving from the summer
fircs] In au the common editions, the

term here rendered moon, is solem, ‘⁴ sun,'’ and
thus, again, the word sun in ver. 658. is, in like man-
ner, rendered lunam, “moon.'' This double error
was first detecied by Bentley; who proves, from
what immediately occurs in ver. 660, which certainly
cannot bc said m apply to the moon, that the trans-
position now adopted was the original reading. ΜΓ.
Wakefield, as might naturally be expected, has availcd
himself of this reading, and supported the propriety

of the change by parallel passages from other poete.
See Note on ver. 660.

Ver. 658. Thus moves the sun too, ] In all the

common editions, as I have already observed in Note
on ver. 654, we here meet with lunam, “ the moon.'’
To the above Note I refer the reader for the change.

 

Ver. 660. Roll their vast munds, andfill the mighty

year.] This verse will not apply to the

common readings, in which the term, two lines above,

here translated sun, ‘⁶ :olmss’ is written moon, “ lu-

ηαηις” and demonstran-s the propriety of Bentley's
alteration. In the original, it occurs thus:

Qae volvunt magnos in magnis orbibus annos.
Ver. 643.
And the verse is conjectured by Creech, but idiy
and inconsiderately‚ to signify either the revolutione
of the superior planets Mars, Jupiter, and saturn, or
the great Platonic period of 25‚579 sydereal years, in
which it was supposed that the stars would com-
pletely run through all the degrees of the ecliptic‚
