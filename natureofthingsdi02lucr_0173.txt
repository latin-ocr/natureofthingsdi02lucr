THE NATURE OF THINGS.

Or when, at length, the full ripe honr is reach'd ’

Of vigorous manhood, and the genial stores

1050

Crowd through the members——ceaseless then, at night,

Forms of the fair, of look and hue divine,

Rush on the spirit, and the ducts of love

So titillare, where throngs the new-born tide,

That, as the tendes toil were all atchiev'd,

F ull Hows the stream, and drowns the snowy vest.

For, as we erst have sung,

mangling machin-:s 3 and the similarity offidea, conveyed
by their names, is truly curious ι a mere accident, in
all probability, but curious ncvertheless.

Some idta os the ingenuity of the ancients, with
respect to trades and manufactures, and of their mi-
nute adherencc to much which is supposed to be of
modern origin, may be collected from this brief
statement os their various operations in the compo·

uition ofstuffs and cloths. ln every other branch of
eloathing, as well as in almost every other branch of
ans or scienccs, they seem to have been equally for-
tunate and expett. But to follow them with a mere
glauce, through the whole, would require a volume
instead of a Note. I will only add, with relation to
the subject now more immediately before mc, that
nothing can exceed the judgment with which they
oelected colours for stufl‘s, cottona, linens, or silke,
or what answercd the purpose os silke, when colonrs
were their object iu view ς or the dexterity with which
they applied them. These were exn-acted both from
thc- vegetable and the mineral kingdoms ; and without
confining themselves to cloths or silke, they dyed,
with :qual elegancc and effect,leathcrs‚ ivory, tortoise-
cheu, horn, the hairofanimaln. woods, cartha, wax, and
even »tonet and marblee. See Note: un v. 327· and
924. of the present B00k; and Book 11. v. 239.

the seeds of life

 

——Bahylonica, magnifico splendore.

Thc Babylon here referred to was a city of Egypt,
at no great distance from Cairo: it was univers-all)-
celebratcd. during its prosperiiy, sor its very beau-
tiful embroiderioe, and, more particularly, the rich.
ness and magnificence of its purple colour, extracted
from the murex by a process peculiar to itstlf. In
consequence of this circumstance, and, at thc same
time, of the exorbitant price charged sor its intro-
duchon, it became hy far the most sashionablc tinc-
ture in all tln: tapettrics, carpets‚ connterpnncs, and
sofa c<2verings of tlit· opulent and luxurious ofGrecce
and Rome. Hence Homer:

vuer-px aye Bm,- AXinMvg,

 

Εισεν χ’ εγ absectum, ’tarmen ’n πορζῖιρεωση.
Itum, 1. roo.
With that the cliiess beneath his roos he led,
And placed iu scats wnhpsaplc carpas spread.

which requires no small degree of delicaey and dex-
