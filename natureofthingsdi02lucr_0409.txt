Boon v. THE NATURE OF THINGS. 395,

Mid his vast elephants‚ and victor hosts, 1 -

DJ

And tempts the gods with vows, and prays, aghast,

For winds appeas'd‚ and soft succeeding gales ?

Yet vainly : for the wild tornado oft

Hurls him all headlong to the gates of hell.

He made darkness his secret covert around him 3

The sacred Scriptures, both Jewish and Christian,
are replete with the same imagery. 1 have referred
to a variety of instances in the preceding Life of
our poet, p. 71, 72. The following from Isaiah
offers us another, and of equal force and pertinente,

ch. xlv. 1 ς.
Verily thou art a God that hidest thyself‚
O God of Israel! the deliverer.

So in Matt. vi. 17. 18. “ But thou, when thou

It is almost impossible to conceive that Milton had

In the following verses of Hesiod there is sorne-

thing so truly coincident with the divine auperintcnd-
anee and sovereign control, as expressed in the text,
but more especially with the celestia! hierarchy of
the Jewish and Christian system, that the reader will
readily excuse my transcribing it. If the popular
deities of the Greeks had been uniformly thus re-
presented, there would have been little occasion sor
the interference of the Epicurean philosophy to have
attempted any correction of the general crccd :
