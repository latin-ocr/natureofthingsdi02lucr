Vcr. 604- Led on by ΡΑΝ, with plne-lcav'd gar-
land crownug] The history and genealogy

·of this deity is involved in much obscurity. That
hc is of very ancient date, we learn from Herodotus,
who tells us that he was known among the Egyp-
tians: and Mr- Bryant, from analyting his name up-
on the system of his Ammonian Radicals, has given
him an origin still more ancient, and contended that
he must have been of Babylonian race, since Pi-An
or P‘-An is the “ Oracle or inspiration ofthe Sun :”
whence he proceeds to assert “ that he obviously con-
stitutcd one of the deities to whom the system of so-
lar worship was directed among this superstitious
people.'’ His image, according to Herodotus, was
carved and painted, both among the Egyptians and
the Greeks, with the sace of a female, and the legs
of a male goat. Hereby, perhaps, becoming an
apt emblem of geizerative power. Γραφονσι ὃς δη κα,
γλυφουσι ὀι ζωγρκφοι και δι αγαλμειτοποιοι του Ποινος, κα-
ταπερ Ἕλληνες, τωγσιλμκ, αἰγοπροσωπον και τραγοσιςλςα.

of the poets, was the inventor of the sweet and ru-

forms, at the present day, a common accompaniment
to the street-organ. Thus Virg. Ecl. ii. 32.

Pan primus calamos cera conjungere plures
Instituit.

 

The construction ofthe modern pipe ofPan, or mouth-
organ as it is denominated, and by no means impro—
perly, by the players upon it, is precisely similar to
that referred to by the pastoral poets of Greece and
Rome ; and the mode of sounding it with the upper
lip recumbent, and flying over the hollow reeds, is by

no means different, as we learn indeed, from the very
verse before us :

Unco saepe labro calamos percurrit hianteis.

As this instrument is constructed at present, the
number of reeds varies from seven to twelvc or four-
tecn ; exhibiting a broader scale than perhaps the pipe
of Pan was ever possessed of among the Greeks and
Romans. Yet even this is in some degree uncertain ;
for although itis generally conceived that the ancient
fistula consisted but of seven reeds, in consequence of
Virgil's having thus represented that os Damaetas in
the eclogue just quoted ε

Est mihi dispar-Ibus septem compacta cicutis
Fistula, Damaetas dono mihi quam dedit olim:

A pipe is mine, os seven unequal reeds,
Gift of Damaratus, fam'd for genereus deeds ι

Yet that it often exceeded this compass, we are sully
assured from the mention of one in Theocritus, that
extended to nine :
