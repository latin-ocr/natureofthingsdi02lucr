DE RERUM NATURA:

In manibuS, vir utei faetus videatur adesse:

Aut alia ex ‘alifi facies, aetasque, sequatur :

Quod ne miremur, sopor atque oblivia curant.

The dogma the poe: is now about to introduce, has
given great umbrage to Lactantius, and a host ofan-
notators who have followed him, from an idea that
it is purposely designed to deny the existence of a
Providcnce, and the intentional mechanism of the
human frame. “ Qid ais, Epicure ?'' says he, al-
luding to a parallel passage in the writings of this
founder of the sect, “ non sunt ad videndum oculi
nati? Cur igitur vident. Postea, inquit, usus eorum
apparuit: videndi ergo causa nati sunt.·-Sed videli-
¹cet qui summam veritatis amisit, semper erret neccsse
est.’' And thus we frequently find it in modern li-
terature: an erroncous interpretation is first given to
n particular passage, and the author is next abused
for ideas that never entered his mind.

However common may be the belief, that Epicu-
rus inculcated the dogma that all things originally
arose, and still continue to arise fortuitously, New-
ton himself never contended more strenuously sor the
existence of a system of permanent and invaniable
lawe, by which all nature is regulated‚ than both
himself and his poetic disciple before uS, nor laboured
more ardently to establis-h the proofsssos such exist-
ence. It is not here asserted that thc external or-
gans of sense were not created for appropriate uses,
but that they do not indicate their own uses. And
now let me ask, how far is such assertion inconsistent
with the theory of Locke, of Hartlcy‚ or of any
other philosopher of high repnte among Christians?
or, rather, without being systematizcd by any school,
how far is it inconsistent with the testimony of Na-
ture herself, and the facts and expetit-nce of every

day? The eyes see things, undoubtedly, the moment
an infant is born—but do they indicate the use of
seeing ἶ Are thc hands acquainted with the power of
touching and handling? Do the legs support the
body, or even intimate that it is to be supported by
them? Can the tongue speak 3-15 lauguage in re.

tion ? In effect, we know not, from its own intima-
tion‚ the use of any one organ of the human body:
we find ourselves possest of a great and ample variety
of organs 3 but our own invention is appealed to with
respect to these ns with respect to every thing else ς
it is experience‚ observation, and habit alone‚—-our
own personal exerfion, and the education we receive,
that tenches us how to employ, to any degree of ad-
vantage, the saculties with which we are gifted.
But if the proposition advanced by our poet, that no
organ is naturally m· intuitively apprized of its own
use, be objected to by such casuists as impious and
irreligi0ns‚ what would they have said if he had taken
the converse of the question, and maintained, that.
every organ of the body was naturally acquainted
with its own purport and design from the very mo-
ment of its birth? Here, indeed, they might have
found ample room for their favourite charge of im-
piety3 but it is neither candid nor philosophica} to
impute the same error and irreligion to converse and
opposite tenets. . The mere man of nature, the tor·
pid and indolcnt savage, in many instanees, never
uses more than half the organs with which he is en-
dowed; and it depends upon the climate he inhabita,
and the mode oflifc he punires, as to what {argans
