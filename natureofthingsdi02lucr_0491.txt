ΒοοΚ VL' THE NATURE OF THINGS.

Flight that, if powerless of itself to fire,
Alone, must warm the mischief in its fall.
So speeds th’ aerial shaft, its wing so Heet,
So fierce its fell encounter3 mid the clouds
So wide its infant forces it collects,
And striveS, impatient of restraint, t’ escape!
Till, grown mature, the full-distended cloud
δ Bursts instantaneous, and, with matchless might,
Rushes the rampant meteor, as the storm
Of rocks, and darts, from giant-engines hurl’d.

Then too most light, most subtle are its seeds:
Whence nought can e'er resist it, and, with ease,
Winds it, uncheck'd, through potes minutest trac’d,

Void of delay, and peerless in its speed.

All, too, of weight possess’d, below must tend
E'en from their nature; but when once to weight
Its power propulsion adds, the substance urg'd
In force, in fleetness (loubled must descend,

Direct iu travel, and more potent far
