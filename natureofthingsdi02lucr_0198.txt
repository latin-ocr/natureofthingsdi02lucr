she could by any means become possest of such a
title. But if the render will refer to the Note on
Book ῙῙ. 1167. he uin there find that the term Δη-
μητηρ, which was afterwards applied to the goddess
Γη, οι· great body of the Earth, was originally attii-
butcd to Venus, or the Egyptian Aphrodite, who
was also regarded as the great parent. or mother of
gods and rnen. Venim, or Aphrodite, is univer-
snlly represented, however, net only in this character
cf having given birth to all things, but as having her-
self arisen from the ocean. And the reader will there
sind that the Demeter, Venus, or Aphrodite, was no-
thing more than a type of ῑΗε ark, containing within
its womb the racc οἱ future heroes who would be dei·
fied, that of men and of animale, ; and existing alone
upon a fathomless and unbounded ocean. Tne Ser-
pent. Hoph. or Ορε, was uniformly worshipped in Ba.
bylonia and Egypt, frcxn the supposed posses-
sion of nisdom, and, consequently, the power of pro.
tection: he was represented as hovering over th3s
Ark, or Venus Demeter, in the form ofa Diagon,
or winged Sei pent ε and when the same fact was al-
lnded to, under the type of a mundane (ξμς floating
upon the surface of the waters, and containing within
nst-If the elementalgerms of the future world—as en-
circling it with its glittering scales for the same ex.
press purpose. In this manner, therefore, the g* (ζ
Ops, or Serpent, became a constituent part of the
hieroglyphical figure of Venus, or Aphrodite Deme-
ter ς and communicated to it his express name. And
when, in process of time, the term Demeter was also
applied to the Earth, aud this, under another system
of idolatry, was conceive-d to be the common parent,
or mother ofall things, the additional term ρ 0⁴21 was
communicated to her at the same period, and became
a commntable denominatim.

With resprct to Bacchus, hc is well known to have
been one of the earliest deities of chaldea. as his
name, indeed, sizfficiciztly explains, which is literally
(35:253) Bis-clius, ‘'- tlze son of Chus.’‘ But

Chus, or Chush, was the son of Ham, and conse-
quently the grandson of Noah. We may naturally
conclude, therefore, that he was an early descendant
ofthis vcnemble patriarch, and a Cushite or Hammo-
nian of considerable celebrity, who pursued. with pe-
cnliar eminence. the favouritc occupatiori, after the
flood, of his great progenitor Noah, and, like him.
‘⁸ was an husbandman, and planted vineyards.” Of
which 3150, like Noah, it should seem, from the
traditions generally attributed to him, that he liberally
partook‚ ‘⁶ became drunken, and was nncovered with-
in his tents.'' Gen. ix. 20, 21. And hence the
first origin of that devotion which was paid to him
after his idolatrous deification by hia descendants, as
the god of the vine 3 as well as the orgies, or obscene
and inebriate rites, with which he was annually cele-
hratcd.

Bacchus, in the table of ancient mythology, how-
ever, is stated to have been the son of Semele, by
Jupiter Ammon. The history is given at full length,
in Diod. Sic. i. p. ²47· Ed. Wesffel. and the fable
admits of an easy solution. It would occupy, how-
ever, too much space to unfold it in the present Note ς
and I refer those who are anxious for further in-
forma-‚ion to Mr. Allwood’s Literary Auxiquities of
Creece, Sect. iii. p. 161.
mon. is doubtless a deified personification of Ham,
the father of chus, adored under the title of the
Son, or the most glorions of existent being83 for
Ham—On is strictly Ham, the Sun, and is nearly
analogous to the dignified appellatione at present “
commun to every Oriental prince, who is styled
“ Lord of the Sun and Moon,’' or ‘⁵ of the Hermen·

and the heavenly Hosts.’¹ In the perplexity of an-

Jupiter Ammon, or Ham-

cient mythology, however, Noah, Ham, and -Chus,
from having this title applied to them, were srverally
worzhiped at different times as the Sun himas:—
and Bacchus, who succeeded to the same honorary
distinction, was consounded in the same manner with
the supreme object of solar idolatry‚ and regarded a·
