From human sense, from matter gross and dull,

Their finer textures never can impress

Material objects, for whate'er exists-

Intangible‚ itself can never touch.

have all thought it necessary to suppose the Creator
himself possessed of some portion of matter in his
e'ssence. The last, indeed, in the very words of Lu-
cretius, has expressly declama, that without some
such possession of matter, he cannot conceive of any
mode by which tlte Deity can operate on the ma-
terial world. Upon this subject, see the prefixed
Life of Lucretius, and its Appendix.

On the system of Des cartes, it must be con-
sessed‚ that matter and spirit are, in every quality
and property, necessarily opposite to each other,
and can have no possible connexion or reciprocal in-
fluence. But the more we analyze matter, the more
it eludes us, till, at last, we find oursclves totally
ignorant of the nature of its substance. Of spirit,
again, no man pretends to know any thing: and,
for aught we are acquaintcd with to the contrary,
their substances may be one and the same. But al-
lowing them to be different entities, why suppose it
-impossible for them to co-exist and confederate?
Spirit, indeed, even admitting of a distinction, is a
term which we never can employ otherwise than ne-
gatively, to express some kind of essence that is not
matter. Yet, for any thing we know to the con-
trary, there may be ten thousand different essenccs
existing, which are all equally· different both from
matter, and from each other, and yet equally made
subservient‚ by the benevolent Divinity, to the pur-
poscs of life and happiness. In this case, the tei 111
spirit will apply to all the various substrata of being,
except that of matter alone.
wc then to suppose, that all these must necessarily
be diametrically hostile, and in opposition to matter?
And sor what reason, again. are wc to suppose, that

must necessarily partakc of the substance upon which
he open-ates? Is it not much more rational, as well
as much more sublime, to conceive. that whatever
be the number of substances he has created for the
beneficent purposes 011113.Ι and liappiiiess,tvcn though,
as I have before observed‚ they should amount to
ten thousand, his own esseut-e is equally different
from all of them? The sun is pei-pctually ponring
forth a ssood of light, in variously coloured rays, from
its own body: but must the body of the sun be
hence necessarily violet, indigo, blue, or some othei
tincture discos-emble by the solat· prism? or even a
tincture derivablc froin an internnxture of the trhoh ?
No astronomer supposes that it is so: no one, in
reality, supposes tbat, although licat and light are
continually issuing from it, the substance of the sun
is oue umform mass of heat anti light itsclf. In like
manner, with tlae permission of comparing small
things with great, wc may conceive a ssood of life
and happiness to be perpetually emanating froin the
Deity in a vast ‹liversity of venich-s. Matter we may
denominate one of these vehicles3 spirit, if applied
to a single substance, a second ; and thus there may
be ten thousand others of which we can form no
conception. But it is no more necessary 111111 the
Dcity himself should bc compriunded either os mat-
teror spirit, still using this latter term as an indi-
vidual vehicle or subs-uatum, or of any other vehiclc
that issues from his own esst-nce, οι· evan ot⁴ the
whole together, 111.111 that the sun should bc coin-
poundcd of any individual prismatic huc, or of the
whole conjunctivcly.
