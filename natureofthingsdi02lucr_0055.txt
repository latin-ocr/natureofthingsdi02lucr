Boox lv. THE NATURE OF THINGS. 43

Proves the same substance is a cube by day ἓ-
Hence shapes‚ hence images alone create
All we survey, of vision the sole cause: 245
And hence from every object forms like these
T owards every point must radiate ς since the eye,
Source of all sight, where’er its orb inclines,
Sees all that moveS‚ in shape and hue precise:
And since such semblances alone decide 2 50
How distant dwells each substance we discern.
These sole decide3 for every film exhal’d
Drives on immediate the recumbent air
Plac'd ’twixt the visual orb, and object view'd.
Then fleets its total column, o'er the ball 255
Rushing amam, till all its gradual length
Strikes on the sentient pupil, and retires.
Hence how far distant judge we things exist3
And as an ampler air, and larger tide
Of friction goad the vision, cautious, thus, 260
Deem more remote th’ objective substance lies.
While such the speed evinc'd, at once we tell
The thing survey’d, its distance and its kind.
Nor wondrous this, that, though, when singly urg'd,

The meaning is too obvious ιο require a com· and yet Des Contures has given a translation which
ment: it was impossible for himself to have understood:
