THE NATURE oF THINGS.

37

Pour’d from the ftont of things, by nought delayed 2

Seest thou not these, in the same point of time,

With swifter ssight through ampler bounds must dart

210

Τ han the blue radiance that through ether streams ?

To proofs thus cogent of the rapid race

Of insubstantia] semblances, adjoin

This fact decisive; that, when once at night,

Beneath the spangled concave, gleams the vase

215

Fill’d from the bubbling brook‚ the curious eye

Marks in the lymph‚ responsive, every star

That strews with silver all the radiant pole.

Seest thou not hence, then, in what point of time

Th’ etherial image darts from heav'n to earth ?

Hence doubly flows it such stupendous forms

 

thue supremely attenuate, should be able to resist,
without total destruction, the Friction of the column
of air, through which they must pass before they
reach the eye: or that those which have reached it,
and communicated the picture, should be able to
return without jnstling against, and disarranging
othcn which are still travelling in a regular direction
to the same organ. Of the former part of this dif-
ficulty, our philosophie poet is sully aware 3 and he
at least palliates it, by admitting‚ that the effluent
semblances osan objecta are, in effect, constautly in-
jurcd by thc friction os the acrial medium and,
that the injur-y they eustain is in a precise ratio to
the space they intersect: and, hence, he ingeniously
accounts, as will bc found in the progress of the ar-
gument, for thr aucun-acy with which the sight de-
termints upon objectis near us, :md the confusion and
fallat-y that too frequently attend its decisione upon
those at a distance (see ν. 372-382) : the projectet]

 

effluvium being considerably abraded or frittered by
the tide of air, through which it travels from the ob·
jective substance, till at length, with increase of dis-
tance, and, of course, increase of friction, it becomes
totally destroyed and dissipated.

This solution, nevertheless, though ingenious, is
by no means satisfactory3 nor um 1 aware of any
principle, upon which tht¹ philosophy of Epicurus
accounts for the perpetual return ofprojcctcd imngcs,
whether from the eye or the mirror,xvit}1011tintersering
with, and injuring those which are advancing towardz
the same spot. But is the difficulty totally annihi-
lated by the Ncwtoninn sy tvm? The current ofliglit
