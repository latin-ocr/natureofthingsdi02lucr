Boon VI. THE NATURE OF THINGS. 571

Than the cold steel, all horror to the touch.
'Whence wond'rous less the doctrine thus announc’d
Thar from the steel those atoms ne'er can part,
Urg'd through the vacuum, but the ring succeeds: 1045
Abrupt succeeds it, gains the stone abrupt,
And fixt and firm in mystic league coheres,
So flies it, too, tow'rds every point alike,
Borne upwards, or transverse, where’er the void
Spreads round the magnet, following, in its course, 1050
The seeds that nearest touch the vacant sphere,
Themselves hence foremost ptest from strife within,
And powerless, else, through ether e'er t' ascend.
Hence, too, the ring draws pinions in its ssight:
That as, at once, secedes th' anterior air, 1055
And forms the void, th' clastic tide behind
Drives it, perpetual plying at its back.
For air encircles all things3 but alone
Can act coercive, and the steel protrude
When first the momentary void existS, 1o6o
Opes its pure passage, and admits it free.
Then potent acts it; through the total ring,

Through every pore, its puny atoms dans,
