By many a month worn out3 or that the calf

THE NATURE OF THINGS.

Casts on his birth-day3 or the spotted robe

Rent from the snake, that trembles on the briar,
The briar full oft with spoils like these bedeckt.

Since these exist, then, floscules rarer still

May, too, be exiled from the face of things :

For why the grosser, palpable to sight,

should rather thus exfoliate‚ than the flake

Of finer texture that all sight eludes

Anthologia is an epigvam of Antipater, of which
the following is the first couplet :

Αρκει τεττιγαις μεθυσιι ὃροτος, αλλαι τιοντες

Αεῑδην Χυκϊων Ησι Ύξγωνῠτξρθλ.

In dew, that drops from morning’s wings,
The gay cicada sipping floats ;

And drunk with dew his matin sings,
Sweeter than any cygnet’s notes.

And thus Gessner in his idyl, entitlcd Mycan,
equally atta-mive, with oni· own poet, to the scason of
the close of the summer: und dic grillo und dic heu-
aclirckc zwitscherten unter dem schatten dci· bliittcr
im geseng'eten grase. ‘⁶ And the cricket and the
gras³-liopper were chirping in the parched grass, bc-
neath the umbragcous foliagc.”

this account, it has neither ura-:hus nor alantois;
its involucrum is simple and undividcd‚ and is filled
with the flnid denominated the amnios alone, which,
by its light and cquable pressure, admirably defends
it from the chance of extet-nal accidents: and, per-
haps, supplies it with nutriment, as the placenta
does with oxygcn and caloric.

lt is curious to observe how carelessly, as well as
erroneously‚ Crcech has translated this passage,

Et vitulci‚ quom membranas de corpore summo
Nascentes mittunt ε

The licifers cast the membr-aues oslhcir horus.

Book ΙΙΙ. v. 626. Vix-gil has described the same
fact more at large in the following verses :
