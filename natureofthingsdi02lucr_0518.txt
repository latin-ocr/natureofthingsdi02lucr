DE RERUM NATURA.

L1 13. VI.

Sed vehe- ens imber fit, ubei vehementer utraque

Nubila vi, cumulata, premuntur, et inpete venti.

At retinere diu pluviae, longumque morari,

Consuerunt, ubi multa fluenter semina aquarum,

Atque aliis aliae nubeS, nimbeique rigantes,

Insuper, atque omni volgo de parte, feruntur3

Terraque quom fumans humorem tota redhalat.

Heic‚ ubi sol radiis, tempestatem inter opacam,

Advorsa fulsit nimborum adspargine contra;

Tum color in nigris exsistit nubibus arqui.

Ver. 544. Ceaseless rgllects, and rears the gaudy
bow.] Our poet, with suitable modesty, dis-
cusses the phaenomenon of the *rain-bow in very few
words: for 1 have already observed‚ that the doc-
trine of dioptrics, or refracted light, on which its
solution principally depend5‚ was totally unknown
to the philosopher-s of Gi-eece and Rome. See Note
on Book IV. v. 33. He offers, however, three ob-
servations upon this elegant meteor, and they are all
minutely true to the fact itself. The first is, that
it proceeds frorn a shower of rain ; the second, that
this shower must fall in a quarter directly opposite
to the apparent station of the sun; and the third,
that the solat· light, striking upon the drops of which
the shower consists, is reflected from them, and
hence conveys the picture to the eye.
This accurate and philosophie opinion of our poet
is the more surprising when contrasted with the
common belief of his day, that the rain-bow was a

from the following passage, to have been acceded to
by Virgil :

 

et bibit ingens
Arcus—

Deep drinks the mighty bow-

And is thus referred to by Hippolyto Capilupi, in
his epitaph on a drunkardz

Dum vixi sine fine bibi, sic imbrifer arcus,
Sic tellus pluvias sole perusta bibiti

While life was mine I drank through every hour,
As earth, as rain-bows drink the rushing show’r.

In the Note on Book IV. v. 144. I have explained
the cause of the iris or rain-bow upon the modern
theory of optics. To this explanation Ι refer the
reader, and shall only add, in the present place, that
the idea of such an explanation was first conceived'
by Fletcher of Breslaw in 1571, and afterwards suc· ’
