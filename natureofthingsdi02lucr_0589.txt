THE NATURE OF TIIINGS.

F irst throws, as nearest, its attenuate brcath,

And fills the pores of ir0n3 which when, next,

The stream magnetic reaches, it in vain

Toils to transl-neree, each avenne possest.

Check’d in its course, with wave perpetual, hence,

The rings, the raspings bears it, and above

Far off repulses, else embracing strong.

Nor strange conceive it the magnetic stream

Nought drives besides : for powers there are resist‚

1090

Like the firm gold, confiding in their weight3

While some a frame so loose present and rare

The rushing vapour permeates, void of touch.

Such frame all timbers offer.

But the steel

Springs ’twixt the two : and hence, when through its pores

Clogg'd with the brass effluvium, the full flood

1096

Flung from the magnet dashes it sublime.

Nor arc such unions through created things

Discern'd unfrequent, nor severe the rask

To point affinities of equal strength.

Lime only stones connects; the strong, stcer-glne

matter, lime, or calx, as our poet denominates it in
the verse before us, is a cause of lapidification, or the
junction and increase of stones of every kind, so
much more common, and at the same time so much
more powersul and apid, that in comparison even
with solutions of iron itself, and most unquestionably
in compat-ison with every thing else, he may well
say that lime, calx, or calcareous matter, is the only
cement or connecting medium of stoneS, the chief, or

sole cause oslnpidification. Staret-ly :my other cc-

mcnt is ever employed in masonry—but it is tm-
ploycd on a much broadcr scale by nature herself.
The vast quantitics of lime-stone or canlcarcous carth
diffused through the oct-nn is obxions from the im-
mense shoals of>l1elhfishcs which :nc pc>pttnally
forming in its bosom, and the case with which they
rccovcr their defensivc ineffizstntions when deprived
of them by accident, or annual exfoliatitnm if1'2.
