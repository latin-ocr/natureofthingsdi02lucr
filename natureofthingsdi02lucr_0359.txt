M. Cuvier is at this moment engaged in amassing a
museum of animal sossils, for the express purpose of
deciding, as far as is practicable‚ the number of spc-
cies osanimals that are now actually lost to the world.
No man can be better qualified for the purpose, or
possessed of more activity. Some knowledge, in-
deed, of his activity‚ and the extent os his inquiries,
may be collected from an express dissertation hc has
lately published (1801) Sur les Especes dc Quadru-
pcdes dont on a trouve les ossemcns dans l’intcrieur
de la Terre. In the course of two years alone, be-
ing the period in which he had then applied himself
to this immediate stndy, he was able, by his own ‹li-

not less than twenty-three species, at present un-
known, but whose existence in remote ages is ascer-
tained hy their remains. “ This remarkable quantity,’'
