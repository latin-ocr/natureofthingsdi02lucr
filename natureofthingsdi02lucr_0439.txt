ia said to have invented them prior to his having quit-
ted Phoenicia, we are still able to trace the existence
of letters as far back as the year before Christ two
thousand one hundred and seventy-eight, and, conse-
,quentlffi not more than a century and a half from the
period of the Noachic deluge. Such is the account
given by Sanehoniatho of Berytus in Egypt, the
oldest prophane historiari of whom, out of Hindustan‚
any remains have reached us. Sanchoniatho was con-
temporary with king Abibalus‚ the father of Hiram,
the friend and ally of Solomon; and consequently
flourished not less than oue thousand and seventy-
three years before Christ. It was to Abibalus that
he dedicated his history of the Phoenicians, which
was translated in the reign of Vespasian, by Philo of
Biblus, and of which also various fragments are still
preserved in Eusebius.

It is from the same common stock of symbolie ele-
ments, that the Greeks derived their alphabet, which
has divaricated into 3 greater variety of brauches than
any other in the world. and has given birth to almost
every existing alphabet in old or modern Europe. It
is doubtful in what manner, or in what aera the
Phoenieian letters reached Greece, som: writers
attributiug their introduction to the Pelasgians, who
were an unsettlcd and wandering branch of the Phoe-
nician family, and who, in the course of their migra-
tions, planted colonies in Old Helas, Argolis, Ar-
cadia, and the coast of Peloponnesus, while others
maintain that they were conveyed into Greece

through the medium of Egypt, or rath-:r directly
from Egypt. Itis well known, however, that the

lettera of the Greek alphabet did not all arrive 31 one
time. And it is hence probable, that the original al-
phabet‚ which consisted of not more 111311 sixteen let-
ters, was introduced by colonica os l'hoenician Pc-
lasgi; and that the rest were imparted from Egypt

at different periods: of these last, Palamedes is uid
to have had the honour of introducing tlte four dou-
ble letters Θ, Ξ, Φ, Χ, about twenty years before the
common date assigned to the capture ofTroy ς 1111111.-
to Simonides is generally ascnbcd the addition of
Z, H, Ψ, Ω. Yet there are ancient Greek inscription·
ofa date anterior to the age of even the former, in
which several of both these latter series make their
appeamncessinscdptions, os which the Abbc‘ Four-
mont has given us specim-ena, and at the same time
proved their authenticity.

The alphabetic characters os the Indian natione
are uniformly, not excepting those of China, sup.
posed, by most philologists‚ to have been derived
srom the Nagari, or Deva-Nagari, the Dia-ine Na-
gari, as it ia sometimes cant-Q Nagara being the
city in which these elements os the Sanscrit language
were supposed to have been invented. Sir william
Jones imagines, that even these offigunt-d from the

Astle, on the contrary. believes them, as well 31 the

and original. The period 111 which literal charactera
