DE RERUM NATURA.

Proeulcare, ac ludibrio sibi habere, videtur.

Denique, sub pedibus tellus quom tota vacillat,

Concussaeque cadunt urbes, dubiaeque minantur3

Quid mirum, si te temnunt mortalia secla,

Atque potestates magnas mirasque relinquunt

In rebus vireis divom, quae cuncta gubernent ?

Quod super est, aes atque aurum ferrumque repertum est, 1 240

Et simul argenti pondus, plumbique potestas,

the different versions brass, which, as a generic sub-
stantive, i't will undoubtedly include, as well as cop-

aurichalcum, being a compound metal, and the iuven-

is equally general with es, and may alike be adopted
to signify either copper or brass-

The existence of the metals here referred to in the
interior of the earth, is thus described by Carth, in
his Dispensary ε

Here, sullen to the sight, at large is spread
The dull unwieldy mass oflumpish lead ε

There, glimmering in their dawning beds, are seen
The more aspiring seeds of sprightly tin.

And in the gloorn betrays its glowing cheeks:
The silver then, with bright and burnish’d grace,
Youth‚ and a blooming lustre in its face,

To th' arms of those more yielding metals flies,
And in the folds of their embraces lies.
