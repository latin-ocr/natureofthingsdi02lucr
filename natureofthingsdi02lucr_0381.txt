portion of reason and intelligence‚ which must ne-
cessarily demand an infinitely greater variety of
vocal sounds than are requisite for the purposes
of other animals‚ it is not to be supposed that
he would confine himself to the few uneouth
tones of which he was naturally pos-sest, but would
exercise his superior faculty of articulation in the
formation and utterance of tones unexpressed be-
fore, and frequently derived from the sounds or
noises observable in nature—a class of words deno-
minated by the French philosophers, onomatapies—
in which the sound, literally‚ becomes “ an echo
to the sense :’'—and would gradually appropriate,
as in the case of the natural language of animals,
particular tones to particular ideas3 every man,
perhaps, in the primaeval community‚ adding a
little to the common stock, till systematic speech
at length arose, and natural language gave way to
artificial.

Artificial language originating in this manner,
must necessarily, moreover, bnt gradually, upon the
teparation of a community into distinct and distant
colonia, divaricate into a multiplieity of colonial or
mationa! tongues. For new ideas must necessarily
beget new tenes, and the same tone, uncontrolled by
the precision of letters. must frequently differ in its
mode of enunciation, till at length the original tone
be totally forsaken, and another gradually usurp its

place. Of the different colonies‚ again, that ramify
from the common stock, some will be more active
and industrious, and others more indolent and inert 3
and while the former add largely to the original vo-
cabulary, the latter will be gradually losing the re-

be relapsing into a language as meagrc and barren
as the first rude efforts of artificia! speech. Hence
the diversity of languages into which the world is
at present divided; which, numerous as they are,
exhibit proofs of a common origin, and may even
yet be reduced into five or six genera. Hence the
cause of the poverty and barbarism of some lan-
guages, and the suavity and richness of others : and
hence the absurdity and impracticability of the cx-
