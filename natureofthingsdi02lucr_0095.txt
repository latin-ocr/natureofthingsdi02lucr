Boox IV. THE NATURE OF THINGS. 8³

But when at distance urg'd, the sev'ring air 575
Must break each sentence, and the wandering voice

Through the long medinm all connexion lose.

And thuS‚ though sounds attract us, we collect

Nought they should teach‚ so blended and destroy'd.

When, mid the gaping throng‚ the cryer loud 580
Bawls out his mandate, each its purport hears.
Hence, too, the voice to vocicles minute
Severs abrupt‚ since every ear alike
Drinks in each tone with equal clearness felt 3
While what its nerve ne'er reaches, wide diffus’d, 585
WVastes through all ether ; or, if aught, perchance,
Strike some compact enclosure, it rebounds

In faithless speech, mere semblances of words.
