THE NATURE OF THINGS. 515)

Nought e’er can part them τ 11o—though e'en thou toil

Day after day with all great NEPTUNE'S wavcs:

Ι Ῐ 1<3

No—his whole sea the stain would ne'er wash out.

One cemcnt sole with gold concentrates gold,

And nought but pewter brass with brass unitos.

Tagusve, Iberi turbidum gazi fluens,

Abluere dextram poterit ? Arctoam licet

Maeotin in me gelida transfundat mare,

Et tota Tethys per meas currat manus,

Haerebit altum facinus. Hisne. Fun. 13 23.

Can Nile, or Tanais, or the Persic gulph

Boist’rous of wave, or Tigris, or the Rhine,

Or turbid Tagus through Iberia roll’d,

Wash this right—hand ?—-No z—from the frozen
North,

Should flow the Euxine, should all Neptune’s

waves
Pour o’er my hands, this crime would taint me still.

Ver. ι 1 12. One cernent sole with goldconcenlratesgold‚]
1 take the amended Lection of Mr. Wakefield, ver.
1076:

auro res aurum concopulat una.

 

The common reading is, unquestionably‚ incor-
rect, and inconsistent, indeed, with the best copies:

 

res auro argentum concopulat una,

instead of which, and certainly with some improve-
ment, Faber suggests ε

—rcs auro non aurum copulat una.

The cernent here referred to is, doubssess. the
chrysocolla, a mineral sand, found on the shores of
the Red Sea, osan elegant green colour, denomina-
ted by the natives of modern times tincar, or tincal.
The borax, now in use for similar purposes, does net
differ essentially from the chrysocolla, when dissolve-d
and crystallised, and is, by some chemists, supposed
to bc precisely the same.

AEriquc :es plumbo fxt utci jungatur ab albo.

Pewter is, in the present day, the commm sold i
for copper and brass: it is generally a combinatiozx
of tin, lead, and regulus of antimony. From the
lead employed in the manufacture, and the¹ splendid
whiteness of its appearance when too much lowered
or adulterated, it is here happily denominated by oui·
poet plumbum album ς literally “ while lead:'' and by
this term it is erroneously translated by Guernier. 1
say, erroneously; for the cerusse, or white lead of
modern days, is no solder whatever in metallie prc-
parations. Creech omits the verse entirely, and thus
dexterously runs away from the difficulty. Dc Cou-
tures is wrong in the whole passage: ‘⁴ l’argent‚'’
says he, “ est alli& avec l’or. et l’airain avcc le plomb.”
‘⁵ Silver unites itself with gold, and brass with lead.¹’
Marchetti is quite correct :

 

conlo stagno il rame
Si salda al rame

I must leave it to the chemists to determine what
substance was employed formerly, instead of the re-
gulus of antimony ς or whether the ancients were ac-
quainted with a metal of tbi< description. and its dif—
ferent powers in different states of combination.
Yet, probably, the plumbum album, or copper solder
of the Romane, was a mixture oflcad and tin alonc-

Since writing the above, I have met with an ex-
cellent mcmoir of M. Kltiproth, inserted in the Ber—
lin Mcmoircs de I'Acadmnc Κυμὼ· des sciemus,
Vol. for 1792—1795 ι iu which the author asseris,
that the plumbum nigrum ofthe Romans was lead,
and the plumbum album, candidum, or argentarium,
tin. or the awa-‚rigor of the Greeks. There can bc
no doubt that this appellation was generally applied to
tin alone: but as this mctal. when employed sim·

ply, will bc found a very mmm-rent soldcr for copptr.
