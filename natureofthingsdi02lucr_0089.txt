THE NATURE OF THINGS.

Hence all against the sensles urg'd is vain,

Mete idle rant, and hollow pomp of wordst

As, in a building, if the first lines err,

If aught impede the plummet, or the rule

From its just angles deviare but a hair,

535

The total edifice must rise untrue,

Recumbent‚ curv’d, o’erhanging‚ void of grace,

Tumbling, or tumbled from this first defect‚

So must all reason prove unsound, deduc’d

From things created, if the senses err.

Thus perfect smnr, unfold we next, a task.

Not arduous, how each other sense perceives.

SoUND‚ and the vorcn, then, first are felt when deep

Pierce their light corpuscles the mazy ear,

is said to have differed from this common hypothesis
in some small degree, and to have approeched, in
some measure, the system now generally accredited ;
but this belief of Plato does not fully appear from
any of his writings ; which, upon the subject before
us, are doubtful, and involved in obscurity. With
respect to the Steics, and, indeed, every other sect,
they scrupulously coincided with Epicurus, who ex-
pressly taught, as we learn, not only from the testi-
mony of Lucretius, bnt also of Plutarch de Placit.
Philus. iv. ¹9. and Diogenes Laertius, Epist. Epi-
cur. ad Herod„ that voice or sound is an cffiuvium
transmitted from sonorous bodies, by whatever means
they may be excitcd, ⁴ind that this effluvinm consists
of minute corpusclcs of similar configuration5 ca-
pable, like water, of dividing itself into different
drops or portioris, while it yet retains its original
power: whence the same voice or sound may excite

the ears of a multitude of persons at the same time,
and in the same manner.

The modern theory of sound differs as much from
this system of Epicurus as the modern theory of
sight; and, in perfect similarity ιο the former, is
founded on laws peculias to itsclf. Like the Gre-
cian hypothesis, it contends for its production from
a motion os the superficial corpusclcs of the sonorous
body: but, unhke that hypothesis, it assertS, that
these do not actually fly off from the sonui-uus body,

but only vibrate ur undulate at a small distance fre—m
each othcr; and, by such vibratio„ or nmini-mon,
communicate a similar motion to the surroundinbr pai·-
ticles of :iir; which transfer the tame motion, but
always with a small tlt-gree of diminution, to the ad-
joining, till, at length, the motion is propagatctl
through the whole column of air that lies between

the sonoroun body and the auditory organ of the
