DE RERUM NATURA.

Atque, utri simile est magis id, quodquomque creatur,

Ejus habet plus parte aequa, quod cernere possis,

Sive virum suboles, sive est muliebris origo.

Nec divina satum genitalem numina quoiquam

Quod plerumque putant, et multo sanguine moestei

Conspargunt ams3 adolentque altaria donis,

male and female evolution, that no ingenuity of the
most sophistical adherents to either has been able to
explain satisfactorily. The mule, exhibiting in its
own person, about an cqual intermixtum of the male
ass and the marc, affords, perhaps. the strongest de-
monstration of the sallacy of these twin theorics3
and it is m this phaenomenon that the attention
of their supporters has been pi-incipally directed,

valent, among the vulgar, in many parts of this king·
dom. Lactantius, moreover, adjoins, in consequence
of this position, that if the male semen should, by
mistakzn enter the left side of the uterus, a male
child may still be conceived 3 but in as much as it oc·
cupi-:s the ft‘mzile department, its voice, its face,
and its general complexion will be effeminate. In
like manner, if the female semen flow into the right
side of the uterus, and a female fatus be begotten,
the female will exhibit many symptoms os a mascu-
line disposition, and be inordinately vigorous and
mnscular. De Opificio Dei, ch. xii. The syst‘em
of Lucretius is not chargeable with thie nonsensical
puerility5 it accounts for the varietits of sex and
features upon maie plausible and philosophie prin-

ciples. And yet it is not improbable that Lactan-

which it was perhaps imported from the hypothesis
