DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. V.

Omnia enim magis haec e laevibus atque rotundis

Seminibus, multoque minoribus sunt elementis,

Quam tellus: ideo per rara foramina terrae,

Partubus erumpens, primus se substulit aether

Ignifen et multos secum levis abstulit igneis:

Non alia longe ratione, ac saepef videmus,

Aurea quom primum, gemmanteis rore, per herbas

Matutina rubent radiati lumina solis;

Exhalantque lacus nebulam, fluvieique perennes τ

Ipsaque et interdum tellus fumare videtur:

Emicuit, summique locum sibi legit in arce.

be a more just, or a more exquisitely beautiful pic-
ture of the formation of the atmosphere,unless,indeed,
it be the buldly figurative and concise description
of Moses: ‘¹ and the spirit of God moved upon the
face of the waters.'’ In which passage, observes
Mr. Kirwan, the word brt-alh or spirit denotes an in·
visible clastic fluid, to wit, the great evaporation that
took place as soon as the solids began to crystallize.
‘⁸ Of God,'¹ is a well-known Hebrew idiom denoting
Χῆναι,- and the term “
“ hovered.¹'

I have given this passage an interpretation, in some

degree, different, and considerably more literal, in my

msvedss’ obviously means

but it is a difference which will introduce no vari-
ation into the general history of this great event. Ι
have there observed, that the Hebrew term, nnn-572,
in our common versions, rendered moved, occurs but
three times in the whole course of the Bible; and,
in every instance, implies interna! agitation, rather
than simply moving, or bovering over : and that the
phrase, Spiritqu-od, (Ε’Πῆκ ΠῚἾ) rather refers,
definitively, to the time, and cause, and mode, in
which, and by which the first process in the order of
creation occurred, than generally and indefinitely to
a vast or mighty wind of any kind. In consequence
of which, with a slight change in the common punc·
tuatim, 1 would read the first two verses of the
Book of Genesis as follows: “In the beginning,
God created the heavens and the earth. The earth
was yet a desolate waste, with darkness upon the
face of the deep. And the Spirit of God agitated

the watcrs to their surface.''

1t was from this ferment or agitation that the
heat and evaporation, in all probability, proceeded,
noticed by our poet in the verses before uS‚ and still
more largely by Mr. Kirwan himself, in the follow-
ing passage of his very excellent Essays :
