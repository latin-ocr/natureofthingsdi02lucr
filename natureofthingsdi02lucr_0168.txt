Purei saepe, lacum propter—-

The poet undoubtedly refers to the urinary rescr-
voirs crccted iu the strccts at Rome, either for the
purpose of public cleauliness, or for the use of the
sollers who were accustomed to purcllase their con-
tcnts of the Roman government, during the reign of
Vespasian, and perhaps of other emperorS, at a ccr-
tain annual iznpost; and which, prior to the inven-
tion. or gent-ml use of soap, was the substance prin-
cipally employed in their milis for cleansing siuiss-
and cloths previous to their being dycd. The same
excretion from other animals was carefully preserved
and sold to them for the same purpose. Thus Pliny,
xxviii. 8. Cameli—urinam fullonibus utilissimam
esse tradunt. M. Ameilhon, in his first Memoir on
the Colours of the Ancicnts, and the arts which are
connected with them, (Memoircs de l’Instit. Nat.
Lit. et &aux-Ans, tom. I.) has given a full and
correct account of the handicraft of the Greek and
Roman fuller: from which, as offering a surprising
resemblance to the same trade and the manufactures
connected with it, as conducted in modern times,—
and as I do not know that a more proper place than
the present will occur,—-1 shall take the liberty οἷ se-
lectiug various observations5 at the same time adding
a few remarks of my own, in confirmation of their
general purport.

Indepcndently of the excretion just referred to,
Μ. Ameilhon has also proved that, in scouring the
wool from its grosser impuritieS, and the greasy mat-
ter with which it is at first impregnated,--a matter
which by the Greeks was denominated ωσνπεν, and
by the Romans sevum, the fullers of ancient times
employed also a lye, that in Aristotle’s Treatise on
Colours, or the book of this name attributed to him,
is called κονια, and by all the Roman writers lixivium ;
and which differs but little from the lye of the mo-
·derns. They procured it by filtrating water through
wood-ashes burnt for this purpcse. Theophrastus
informs us, that the lye, thus acquired, had a reddish

8

appearance, from the soot that adhered to its saline
particles during the act of combustion : that, to ob-
tain it in a purer form‚it was again strained off through
coarse thick bags, and that the lye most in repnte
was manufactured from the ashes of the oak. Pliny
observes (lib. xxxi. 10.) that in his time these ashes
were in disuse, because they yieldcd too small a quan-
tity of saline particlcs ; as also, because in his time an
alkaline salt was obtained with ease, and in vast
quantities f'om Egypt. This salt was, unquestion-
²131le the natron of modern chemists.

Of the loom, or its component parts, made use of
by the nnciems, M. Ameilhon takes no notice3 but
that it did not differ esseutially from that in present
use, we may fully collect from our own poet’s allu-
sion to many of the przncipal pieces of which its fmmc
consisted. Tium, Book V. ver. 1385. of this trans-
lation ς of the original, lib, v. 1349.

Nexilis ante fuit vestis quam textile tegmen ς
Textile post ferrum 3 quia ferro tela paratur:
Nec ratione alia possunt tam laevia gigni
Insilia, ac fusei, et radii, scapeique sonantes.
The rude-stitched hide preceded the wove vest,
Plann’d aster iron‚ and with irc-n wrought ;
For, without this, the loom had ne’er been fram'd,
Its simules, treadles, sley, and creaking beam-

When the wool, or the woollen stuff, had passed
through the ch-watcr, it was again·washed in a full

stream, and afterwards soaked in a decoction of a ⁵

plant, which by the Greeks was called στρουθος or
m90v91o›; which possessed the quality of whitening
such woollen substatiae, as we lcarn from Theo-
phrastus, Dioscorides, and Hesychius: whence, a-
mong the Greeks, the verb στρουθιζιιν means to whiten
or blanch. It is probably the same plant which the
Septuagint has in view in those passages in which the
verb, in Hebrew denominated ΠἾ] (borith), is
translated by ma, a term occurring in the prophets
Jeremiah and Malachi3 and which literally significa
to wash, to scour, to cleanse. By the Latius, this

plant was named herba lauat-Ia, radix lanaria, as ap-
