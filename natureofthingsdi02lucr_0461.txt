enumerating not less than ten in the course of the dis-
cussion, which extends to ver. 162 of the present
translation. Our poets oslater ages, if they have not
been quite so prolific in their references, have, never-
theless, copied from him very considerably, and, like
himself, ascribed the origin of thunder to a diversity
of operatione in the heavens. Of these, Thomson enu-
merates three. He is speaking of inflammatory sub-
stances emitted into the atmospherc in the form of va-
pour, where gradually they

Lucretius, in the present instance, is adverting to
the second of these, the dash os clouds against
clouds: a cause of thunder which he offers as the
opinion of EpicuruS, who appears to have derived
it from Democritus, in common, indeed, with the
Stoice, and several uther schools.

In modern times, at least till the Franklcian diq-
tovery of the unity of lightning and electri: tire. the
theory of thundcr has not essentially differt-d from
that generally advanccd by the Greek philosophus:
and the tremendum peal, au well as the forky corrun-
cation, has been eqn.=lly attributed to inflammabit· sub-
·ttnces issuing from the bowels of the earth in the form
of vnpour, attracted by the clouds in their astent

through the regions of the atmosphere, and, at
length, suddenly bursting them and taking sire, ei-
ther in consequence of internal fermentation, or thc
assault of one cloud thus impregnatcd against an-
other. Such was the opinion of Newton, wallace
and Homberg.

But the important discovery of Dr. Franklin, in
the year 1752, of the identity oflightning. and the
electrie fluid, has operated a total change in the opi.
nion of the philosophie world, and introduced a new
theory, to which every school has constst itself a
convert. Yet, although electrieity', at least as a sci-
ence, was totally unknown till within thc luat cen-
tury, it is astonizhing to observe what a variety os
