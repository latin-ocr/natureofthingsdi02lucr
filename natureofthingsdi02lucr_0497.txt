Boon VI. THE NATURE OF THINGS. 483

The reign of discord, and the rage of aii·

Tumultuous torn ’twixt winds and rival [ιι-65.

For heat's first rise, and cold's ulterior verge

375

Rear the young spring3 whence things with things, diu-ise

Must meet, and, meedng, into wrath ferment:

While cold's first chills, and heat's last ling'ring benum,

Mutual convolv’d‚ create th' autumnal times,

Still summer striving with stern winter's tage. 38<

W hence spring, whence autumn claim alike the term

Of WARRIOR-SEASONS, thus to fight attach'd.

Nor wond'rous, then, that thunders here should rise‚

And-storms defile the concave‚ by the war
Doubtful, disturb'd, of whirlwind, rain, and fite. 385

Hence may'st thou clear the thunder's essence truce,

And its vast force develope3 from thy hands

Hurling the TUSCAN legends that pretend

Vainly each purpose of the gods t’ unfold,

And thus decide whence flows this wingecl fise: 390

years. The pensant, dismayed at the apparition,
shrieked out so loudly, that all the country of Eun-
ria flocked to his assistance. The philosopher ad-
dressed himself to the astonishcd multitude, and
taught them the doctrine of divination, the principles
of which many of them wrote down upon paper-
bark while he was instructing them. Hence. the
books of the Tuscana are occasionally ssylcd 'l'ugcrie
oracles. To this miraculous personage, Ovid alludes,
in the following verses ε

Fatalem glebam mediis aspexit in arvis
