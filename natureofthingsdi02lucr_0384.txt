erected. There can be no doubt that it exists among
fishes 3 sor, since the discoveries of professor Camper,
as I have already observed, it has been repeatedly
demonstrated that almost every species possesses the
organs of hearing, while the medium in which they
live is not repugnant to the propagation of sound.
Our knowledge of their accuStomed habits, however,
from their reside-nee in a different clement, is so com-
paratively small, that we have no positive facts to
reason from upon this subject. But with respect to
quadrupedS, reptiles, and insects‚ we can speak from
the full evidence of daily experience. 'Almost every
animal of these three orders exhibits a different tone
of voice, according to the governing passion of the
moment ; but nothing can be more accurate than the
division of their language here adopted by our poet
into the three grand sections of grief, sear, andjoy .-
to which, in some instances, we may add the classi-
fication of angcr5 but a distinct tone for angeris not
so generally traced among animals as it is sor the
three passions enumerated in the text.

Among quadrupedS, the elephant, the horse, and
the dog, appear to possess the greatest portion cf
natural speech. They are all gregarious, particularly
the two former. In Asia, the wild elephant, and
in the Ukraine, between the Don and the Nieper‚
the wild horse, pursue one common plan of political
society in numerous and collected troops, and are re-
gulated by magistrates chosen by themselves out of
their own bodies. By a difference of voice, com-
bined with a difference of geniculatim, these magi-
strates or captains give orders, in the course of their
ti-nvels from place to place in pursuit of pasture, sor
the necessary dispositions and arrangements. They
are extremely vigilant aud active, and maintain their
rauks and brigades with as much regularity aud pre-
cision as if they were conducted by man. Among
the wild horst-s of the Ukraiue‚ the captain-general

is commonly appointed to his station for about four
or five years ς at the expiration of which time, a kind
of new electiori takes place: every one appears to
have a ¹ight to propose himself for the office, the
ex-commandant not excepted: if no new candidate
offer, the latter is re-elected for the same term of
time ς and if Le be opposed, a combat succeeds, and
the victor is appointed commander in chief. The
conduct pursued by the peaceable and amiable ele-
phant varies in some degree from this of the wild
horse ι sor the troops of the former are led on by the
eldest, the young and the feeble marching in the
middle, and the rear being composed of the adult and
vigorous. See Buffon, Hist. Natur. and Description
de l'Ukraine‚ par Μ. Beauplau.

The natural language of the ourang—outang‚ and of
all the different species of apes and monkeys, although
they have nearly the same organs of speech as mankind,
appears to be more confined than that of many other
quadrupeds, and we have no proof of their having
ever attempted artificial language. Linne'us, indeed,
asserts the contrary, with respect to the ourang-ou-
tang, and assures us, that he speaks with a kind of
hissing voice : but this is pointedly denied by Buff0n‚
aud certainly rests upon no authenticated fact. At
all adventures, he has a peculiar deficiency of natural
speech ; and we hence obtain an insuperable objection
to the declaration of Monboddo and Linneus, that
they are all of the same species with man, and that
man himself is not unfrequently to be met with in
some of the Asiatic islands with a monkey tail, va.
rying in length from three or four inches to a font,
possessed of as great a flnency of speech as in any
part of Europe. The only instance of continued
narration reported concerning the monkey-class, is
among the tribe of American monkeys denominated
occarines, or preachers. Margraave‚ in his History
of Brasil‚assures us that he has osten been a personal
