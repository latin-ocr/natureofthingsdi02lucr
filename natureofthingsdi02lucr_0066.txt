DE RERUM NATURA.

Lus. IV.

Continuo nequeant illinc simulacra revorti:

< Omnia quandoquidem cogit natura referri,

Ac resilire ab rebus, ad aequos reddita flexus.

Splendida porro oculei fugitant, vitantque tueri3

325

Sol etiarn caecat, contra si tendere pergas :

Propterea, quia vis magna est ipsius, et alte

A'e'ra per purum graviter simulacra feruntur,

Et feriunt oculos, turbantia conposituras.

Praeterea, splendor, quiquomque est acer, adurit

Saepe oculos3 ideo, quod semina possidet ignis

Multa, dolorem oculis quae gignunt insinuando.

Lurida praeterea fiunt, quaequomque tuentur

Arquatei ; quia luroris de corpore eorum

 

Ver. 342. Mark we next,

How hales the eye-bal! every gaudy glore ‚·] Our
philosophie poet, having selected a few of the more
extraordinary problems relative to mirrors, proceeds
to another optical phaenomenon which, at (ii-st sight,
should seem self-contradictory.
quires, results it, that the organ of vision becomes
injured by an exposure to glaring objects, and that
darkness, and even blindness itself, is produced by
excess of light ? In the latter pai-t of the solution of
this query, he appears to have a particular reference
to Democritus, the founder of the atomic school,
who pnrposely blinded himself by the ,method here
pointed out, that the obtrusion of exter-nal objects
on the pupil might not discompose him in the prose-
cution of philosophie pursuits. The fact is described

by Laberius, in the following tetrastich, as preserved
by Aulus Gellius, x. 17.

Whence, lie in-

Democritus, Abderites, physicus, philosophus,
Clypeum constituit contra exortum Hyperionis,
Oculos ut possit effodere, splendore aereo.

Ita radiis solis aciem effodit luminis.

Democritus, the Abderite renown'd,
Against the rising sun, in full array
Planted his shield, whose glare his sight might
wounn :
Ythnce sightless grew he from the darts of day.

Milton, though not guilty of the same self-barba-

rity, appears to have hoped for the same advantage
from his blindness: whence, in his well-known ad·

dress to Light‚ we meet with the following verses:

Thus, with the year,
Seasons return ς but not to me returns
Day, or the sweet approach of ev'n or morri,
Or sight of vcrnal bloom, or summer’s rose,
