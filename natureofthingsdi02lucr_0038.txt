rain-bow: a phzcnomenon which depends upon the
very principle now adverted to, and proceeds, indeed,
from :i double reflection and refraction, or, in other
words, from the globule which produces the arch
being converted into a double mirror, and a double
prisxn. In the formation of this beautiful meteor, it
is necessary to obmve, that the ray which issues
from the centrc of the sun, and does not immediately,
or perpendicularly, pass through the centrc of the
opposed globule of rain, must, upon the common
principles of dioptrics, in consequence of its enter-
ing a transparent body of a different medium from
the atmosphcre itself, in a certain degree, be bem,
deflected, or refracted from the right line in which
it was proceeding ; and hence, instead of passing out
at the posterior part of the globule immediately op-
posite to that at which it entered, it will be driven
towards another limb, or marginal portion of the
globule, and form an angular line co-equal to the
obliquity with which it deviates from a right line
on its entrance into the globule 3 just as a stake, or
the oar of a boat plungcd obliqnely into a river, ap-
pears to be broken 01· deflectcd from the point at
which it enters the water. At this point, the re-
t'=·aeted my, instead of passing out of the globule,
suffers another deflection, but from a very different
:une : for the ray of light having been thrown across
a certain portion of the posterior chamber of the
globule of rain, without permeating it, all behind
its passage becomes necessarily a dark shade, while
the globule¹ itself forms an anterior and polished sur-
facc to it 3 whence a regular mirror is produced, and
the rav is now reflected or thrown back from it, in
the sanie manner ar. an incident ray oflight, or image,
is reflected or thrown back from a looking-glass, or
ει deep and clear stream of water, both of which,
like the globule thus situated, consist of nothing
more than a dark shadow with a polished surface:
the obliquity of its path, in the present instance,
being precisely similar to that which it llas previously
suffered from refraction ; the angular line of reflection
being always co-cqnal with the angular line of inci-

 

dence. lt is hence obvious, that the ray, or fascicle
of parallel rays, which entered obliquely below the

centre of the globule, opposed to the centre of the
sun, must bc reflected obliquely above it ; and as the

same process necessarily takes place, but in an in-
verscd order, with the antagonist ray, or fascicle of
parallel rays that entered with the same degree of ob-
liquity above it, it is also obvious that, from this
double refracting and reflecting power of an indivi-
dual globule of rain, situated as above described, an
angle of light must be formed, from their antago-
nism alone, exhibiting the different colours of which
they consist in a definite order, according to the de-
gree οἱ their refrangibility: that the spread or hy-
poteneuse of the angle must depend upon the diame—
ter of the globule which produces it; and that its
point being sostened or obtunded to the eye by the
distance through which it is beheld‚ agreeably to an
observation of our poet in v. 37 5. of the present Book,
the angle must be converted into an arch. And,
hence, a beautiful and variegated rain-bow must ne-
cessarily result from afew rays oflight acted upon by
a single globule of rain, situated as above, from the
fact alone of its possessing the power of a binary mir·
ror or prism.

But a globule of rain is not the only substance in
the atmosphere capable, at times, of producing the
same effect ς nor, since we are told that the mirage
usually occurs when the sky is peculiarly tranquil
and serene, could it be the cause of this last equally
curious phaenomenon. Our time, however, has not
been lost in thus hastily investigating the theory of
the iris; for the same principles will apply to the
meteor before us. We are informed, not only that
the mirage is chiefly to be noticed when the sky is
clear and unclouded, but in the morning, and princi-
pally upon the coasts or banks of a large river. The
mirage beheld by M. Crantz was on the shore of the
Kookoernan islands near the Cape of Good Hope;
it has often been traced at the back of the Isle of
Wight ; but the quarter in which, perhaps, it most
frequently makes its appearance is the Fato of Mes-
