1300ss IV. THE NATURE OF THINGS. 85

Whence may’st thou solve, ingenuous! to the world
The rise of echoes, form’d in desert soenes, 590
Mid rock3‚ and mountains, mocking every sound,
When late we wander through their solemn gloom5‚
And, with loud voice, some lost companion call.
And oft re-echoes echo till the peal
Ring seven times round: so rock to rock repels 59 5
The mimic simut, re-iterated close.
Here haunt the goat-foot satyrs, and the nymphS,
As rustics tell, and fauns whose frolic clance,
And midnight revels oft, they say, are heard
Breaking the noiseless silence3 while soft strains 600
Melodious issue, and the vocal band
Strike to their madrigals the plaintive lyre.
Such, feign they, sees the shepherd, obvious oft⁷

Of nymphs and fauns! where, in the golden 185. Marchetti has translated it, with his usual
