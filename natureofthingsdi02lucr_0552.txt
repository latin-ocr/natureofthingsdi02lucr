DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. VI.

Ducere {le latebris serpentia secla ferarum.

Quod procul a vera quarn sit ratione repulsum,

Percipe: namque ipsa de re tibi dicere conor.

Principio, hoc dico, quod dixi saepe quoque ante,

In terra quoiusque modi rerum esse figuras:

770

Multa cibo quae sunt vitalia3 multaque morbos

Incutere et mortem quae possint adcelerare:

Et magis esse aliis alias animantibus aptas

Res ad vitai rationem, obstendirnus ante,

Propter dissimilem naturam, dissimileisque

775

Texturas inter sese, primasque figuras:

Multa meant inimica per aureiS, multa per ipsas

Insinuant nareis, infesta, atque aspera tactu:

Nec sunt multa parum tactu vitanda, neque autem

Adspectu fugiunda‚ saporeque tristia quae sint.

An elegant and appropriate image, alipedes .- but
which appears to have been more frequently noticed
and approved by the pocts of Germany than of any

these, the metaphor indeed seems to be altogether
naturalized. Thus Gesner, Death of Abel, i. to-
wards the end. Itzt eilten sie, Frende befliigelte die
fiisse, unter die b'eiume. “ Now hasten they, rap-
turc wings thcirseet, ιο their shady bowers.’' In the
following from Klopstock, there is an additional
degree of spirit—a metaphor breatbing the very

quiritessence of Pindar, or Hafa :

 

der angst gefliigelte stimme. Mnss. v.

 

the winged voice of anguish.

believed this vulgar rumour, or merely introduces
it as a piece of elegant raillery on the credulity
of many natural histor-ians, we have no means
of determining. That such a rumour was very ge-
nerally accredited‚ both among the Greeks and Ro-
mans, we may fully persuade ourselvcs by consulting
Pliny, lib. ii. 33, who adds, at the same time, that the
breath of the elephant produces a similar effect.
From the following passage in the Hitopadesa of
Vishnmmnnan, it should seem that the same belief was
as common in India as in Italy ; and not improbably
applied *a the same manner to an explanation of the
fatal eflects of the local averni of the country: the
translation is that of Sir William Jones. ‘⁶ As a
