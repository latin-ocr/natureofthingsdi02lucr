Boon VI. THE NATURE OF THINGS. 501

Drive the light woof, and weave a thicker shade.
Then, too, perchance, the primal seeds of things

Borne from without, the mingled mass may join‚

And swell the cloudy drap’ry. These how wide 500

Diffus’d through space, how countless their amount,

With what vast speed‚ what instantaneous fiight

O'erpower they every distance, we erewhile

At large develop'd. Nought of wonder, then,

Of amplest breadth‚ their dreary mantle stretch3

Since through all ether's nice, innumerous pores,

O'er the wide world like spiracles bespread,

The thronging atoms enter and retire. 510
Come, nOW‚ and next, how rain in clouds sublime

Forms, and o'er earth in genia] showers descends,

Attentive‚ leam. And, first, the muse shall show

That seeds at once of clouds and water rise

From all created, whence alike augment 5 15
