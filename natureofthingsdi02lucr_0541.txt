Then to the main, too, spreads th' enormous hill

Its roots profound, the rough,

rebellowin g surge

Baffling at each encounter ι for thus far

An ampler storm hence brewing‚ and its flame8‚

The language of Creech gives the general interpre-

Marchetti follows the common interpretation: but
De Contures adhcrcs so fully and satisfactorily to the
