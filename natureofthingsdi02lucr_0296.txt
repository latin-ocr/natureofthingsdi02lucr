DE RERUM NATURA.

Omnia quae‚ sursum quom conciliantur in alto,

Corpore concreto, subtexunt nubila coelum:

Sic igitur tum se levis ac diffusilis aether,

Corpore concreto circumdatus undique, saepsit3

Et, late diffusus in omneis undique parteis,

Omnia sic avido conplexu caetera saepsit.

have occasioned a stupendous conflagration‚ the ef-
fects ofwhich may be well supposed to have extended
even to the solid basis on which the chaotic fluid re-
posed, and to have rent and split it to an unknown
extent.

According to the theory of Lucretius, and in-
deed the history of Moses himself, this stream of
extricated fure was concentrated, as it arose, into the
different and previously extricated orbs of the En,
moon, and stars, which, like so many lenses, §OQ
bielled it to converge into distinct foci, whence tlssey
became themselves fiery and luminous bodies„ But
the farther consideration of the phaenomena of the
heavens, and the different theorics which have been
advanced upon this subject, I defer for the present,
as oui· immediate concern is with the earth alone.

The system of Mr. Kirwan does not admit that
the whole body of the earth, to its inmost centre‚
was in a state of liquefaction at the time when the
phaenomena, which wc at present witness, took place
towards its surface. He conceives, with Boscovich
and La Metherie, that the central parts of the earth,
both at this time, and till many centuries afterwards,
contained immense caverns, and consisted of materials
sufficiently solid to resist the pressure of the cnor-
mous mass of liquid substance placed over them. But
even these very caverns imply the existence of some
equal violence at the centre of the earth, during
come period or other; for they could not have been

produced without some very powerful, and, probably,
volcanie disruptions. The immense masses concreted,
however, and deposited on this interior nucleus of·
the earth, constitute, upon the system of Mr. Kir-
wan‚ the primitive mountains ; the plains being sup·
posed to have been formed in the intervening space
of distant acelivsties, from the gradual and regular
subsidence of the solid particles which were still con-
tained in the chaotic fluid, after the first crystallized
masses had been deposited, -but which were now too
remote from each other's sphere of attraction to con-
crete into crystals; while the greater part of them,
moreover, as the argillaceous particles, were of a
species least disposed to crystallize‚ as possessing
least affinity to the common solvent of water. Hence
the deposit of these must have been level, or without
any great deviation from an horizontal line. The
creation of the sea, or rather the retreat of the now
unembaissassed chaotic fluid into distinct beda and
channels of lower elevation, whereby the dry land
was disclosed‚ and rendered habitable, was produced
by vast and numerous fractures, extending in dif-
ferent directions, through the hollow nucleus of the
globe‚ during the violent conflagrations and volcanos
1 have just noticed, by which this chaotic fluid was
received into the immense and empty caverns existing
towards its centre. This retreat of the chaotic ocean
through the fissures of the central nucleus, Mr. Kir-
wan apprehends to 'nave been very gradual, and to
