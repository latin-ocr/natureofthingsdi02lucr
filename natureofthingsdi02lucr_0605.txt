Boon VI.

THE NATURE OF THINGS.

591

The head first flam'd with inward heat3 the eyes
Redden'd with fire suffus’d: the purple jaws
Sweated with bloody ichor: ulcers foul

Crept o’er the vocal path, obstructing close ;

And the prompt tongue, expounder of the mind,

1190

O'erflow’d with gore, enfeebl'd in its post,

Hoarse in its accent, harsh beneath the touch.

And when the morbid effluence through the throat
Had reach'd the lungs, and fill'd the fault'ring heart,

Then all the powers of life were loosen’d3 forth

Ver. 1187. Redden'd with fire sqffiu'dfl Admi-
rably expressed in the original, ver. 1 144:

Et dupliceis oculos subfusii luce rubenteis ;
and well transfused by Mai-chetti ε

gli orchi rosseggianti, e sparsi
Di sanguinosa luce.

 

The version of De Contures is as foreign from his
copy, as from the truth: ‘⁴ Les yeux etineelloient

sans avoir presque l'usage de leur organe.’'

 

Ver. 1187. thepurplejaws] Ι again fol-
low the copy of Wakcfidd, as being more animated
and significant, ver. ¹¹45 :

Sudabant etiam fauces, intrinsecus autc,
Sanguine ς

The common reading is arro, referring this adjunct

to sanguine. And in the same sense, indeed, Virgil ¹:¹2. ι
1

himself applica it, in his imitation of this passage :
——it naribus aler
Sanguis, ct obsessas fauces premit aspum lingua.
Gsoac. iii. 507.
The tongue surr’d o’er, th‘ obstructed palate silis,

And from the nostrils sahle blood distils.
Sor u F. n 1· .

1195

Ver. 1189. Crept o'er the vocal path, obstruct-
ing close ;] Hence Vin-gil, as cited by
Heyne:
Et via vix tandem voci laxata dolore est.
ΖΕΝ. xi. 150.
The ¹vocalpath obstructed, scarce at length
Left space for sighing.

Hippocrates and Galen equally notice this symp-
ptom. The former, de Morb. Popui. iii. ι5-10-
11 ι the latter in the first book ofhis Commenta-
ries.
