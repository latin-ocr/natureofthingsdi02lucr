manner, to which we are now strange-rs. Our neigh-
bours on the coast of France, and particularly M. le
comte de Cayhrs, have paid much attention to this
subject 3 and the latter has cren ssuttered himself with
a ret-discovery of the true encaustic art of ship-paint-
ing. The plan, however, prescribed by this ingeni·
onis writer, is not, strictly speaking, encaustic, and
probably does not possess the preservative character
represented by the Roman historian. M. de Cay-
lm's mode is, in ess‘cct, nothing more than the ap-
plicatiou of a mere water-colour, afterwards covered
over with a layer of wax and oil, of a due consistency
for the use of the brush; and applied to the wall or

Μ. Le Roi, in his memoir above referred to,
makes mention of ships with three masts constructed
by Archimedes, at the instigation of Hiero; he
gives a drawing of one of this description, copied
from the antiquities of Herculaneum—and believes
that ships with three masts were in use among the
ancients‚ even prior to the time of the Syracusan ma-
thematiciau. Of this ἶ think there can be little
doubt. Many of the vessels of the Greeks and Ro-
mans were of very considerable magnitude and bur·
den; but the grand imperial galley constructed by
Archimedes fm his very excellent relation and king—
thc most magnificent we read of in ancient history,
was built upon so stupendous a scale as to sink the
largest modern ship of the linc into a mere sloop or
brig. This galley, according to Polybius,had twenty
benches of oars, three spacious apartments, and
all the conveniences of a magnificent palace. The
floors of the middle apartment were exquisitcly
inlaid, and represented, in different colorus, the sto-

ries of Homer’s Iliad. The ecilings, windows, and
every other part, were completed with admirable
taste, and adorned with every possible embellishmcnt.
In the superior compartment was a spacious gymna-
sium, with walks and gardens richly stored with
plants of all kinds disposed with wonderful precision.
Pipes, occasionally of lead, and occasionally of bar-
dened clay conveyed the refreshing stream they stood
in need of. But the most magnificent of all the di-
visium, was that dedicated to Venus, as the goddess
who sprang from the ocean : the ssoor of this was in·
laid with agates and precious stones of equal beauty
and value; its lining was of cypress wood, and its
windows were oruamented with ivory, paintingS, and
statues. In this compartment was a librat-y, and a
warm bath: it was heated by three large coppers5
and the bathing vessel was scooped out of an indivi-
dual mass of marble of various colours, and contained
two hundred and fifty quarts. It was supplied with wa·
ter from a large reservoir at the head os the galley,
which held not less than a hundred thousand quarts.
The vessel was decorated on all sides with encaustic
paintingS, and had eight towers of equal dimensions,
two at the head and stern, and four in the middle.
These towers were constantly guarded by young
men, of whom some were archers, and some in mail.
To the side of the galley Archimedes placed an en-
gine, which was capable of projecting stones of three
hundred pounds weight the distance of a stadium,
or an hundred and twenty-five feet. And it gives
us a very explicit idea of the perfection of the an-
cients in the science of hydraulics, when> we read
that, although the hold of this floating palace was
exceedingly deep, a single man was :apable of clear-
ing it of water in a short time, by a pump invented
for the purpose. It was at length made a present
of by Hiero to Ptolemy Philadelphus of Egypt.
If the reader be desirous of tracing the ingenuity of
the ancients in other departments‚ he may con-
sult the Notes on v. 3²7- and 1046. of the present
Book. lt is very extraordinary‚ however, that al-
though the Greeks and Romans were well acquainted
with the magnet‚-the history, aud many of the pro-
