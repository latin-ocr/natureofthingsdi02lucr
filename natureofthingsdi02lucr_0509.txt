THE NATURE OF THINGS.

When in heaven

Meet various bodies subtile and sublim’d‚

Of jagged figure, instant they cohere3

Not strong the junction but cohesive still.

Thus spring the lighter clouds; and these conjoin’d‚

Comprest, condens'd, and congregated close,

Urg’d by the winds, to boundless bulk augment,

su i Colori‚’' published at Modena, 1800.

It has been a matter of great contest among philo-
sophers, by what means water, which is nearly nine
hundred times heavier than air, can be rendered ca-
pable of aseending into the aerial regions. Des Car-
tes accounted for it by supposing that, by the action
ossolar heat upon a sheet of water, its superficial par-
ticles are formed into little hollow apheres, and be-
come filled with the materia subtilis of space, an at·
tenuate substance not unlike the primal atoma of
Lucretius, and which, as 1 have just observed, the
latter conceived ιο be frequently employed as agents
in the formation of clouds. The particles of water,
thus filled, must necessarily, it was added, from the
superior levity of the substance they cnvelop, ascend
through the ambient air till they attain their proper
level. The theory of Dr. Halley was not very dif-
ferent, varying alone in the supposition, that the de-
tached and ascending vesicles of water were impreg-
mted with highly rarefied air, instead ofthe subtle
ether of Des Cartes. But the hypothesis now gene-
rally admitted is that of solution. first of all advanccd
by the abbi Nollet, in his ⁸⁴ Leeons dc Physique
Experimentalu.” VVattr and air, it is contended,
have a mutual power of ‹insolving each othcr; and
nir is not m »re frequently extricated from the former¹
than water ir· 'rom the latter. The lower part of the
Mesphe-re being pressed, then, by [hc weight of the
incumbent column on the unrface of the water, auid
perpetually rnbbing against it, attratftu and dissolv-:n
those particles with which n ie ιιι ευιιιειει, aud sepa—
rate· them from the rest of the water. The aqueoue

parficles, thus detached and absorbed by the lower
column of air, are next still more forcibly attracted by
the superior, in consequence, both of its being drier,
and possessing ampler pores ιο receive the dissolvcd
vapour. When the aqueous particles attain a certain
degree of elevation, the coldness of the atmosphcre
condenses them, and they coalesce into particle« of a
lai‘ger diameter, and gradually produce the phrenome-
uon of a cloud. When the particles, of which ench
cloud consists‚ are more closely committed, either
by the mutual attraction of cohesion, or the ex—
ternal pressure of the wind against it, they run into
drops sufficiently ponderons ιο descend in the form of
γαίη. If the cloud become srozen by any sudden
current of c-›lj air, before its particle-s be formed into
