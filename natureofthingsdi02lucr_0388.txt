DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. V.

Et partim mutant cum tempestatibus un&

Raucisonos cantus3 cornicum secla vetusta,

Corvorumque greges ; ubi aquam dicuntur, et imbreis,

 

Ver. ¹¹03· the sacial1·00k‚] The love
of society in this bird is known almost to a proverb.
Hence Vir-gil, Geo. i. 381 ι “ agmine magno Corvo-
rnm exercitus.” The whole passage is so exquisitely
beautiful, as a picture os natural history, and so ex-
tremely in point with the immediate observation of
our poet, that I shall take the liberty oftranscribing

1t :
nunquam imprudentibus imber

‘Obfuit

e pastu decedens agmine magno

 

 

 

Corvornm increpuit densis exercitus alis.

Jam varias pelagi volucreS, et quae Asiae circum
Dulcibus in stagnis rimantur prata C'eiystri,
Certatim largos humeris infundere rores;

Nunc capnt objectare fretis, nunc currere in undas,
Et stndio incassum videas gestire lavandi.

Tum cornix plena pluviam vocat improba voce,
Et sola in sicca secum spatiatur arena.

Surc warnings still the stormy showers precede.—

 

on rustling pinions loud

The crows (rool’s) a numerous host Ξ from pastui-e
homewards crowd.

Lo l various seaufowl, and each bird that breeds

In A sian lakes, near sweet Cayster-'s meads,

O'er their smooth shoulders strivc the stream to
fling‚

And wash in wanton sport each snowy wing ς

Now dive, now rnn upon the wat’ry plain,

And long to lave their downy plumes in vain ;

Loudly the rains the boding rook demands,

And solitary stalks across the scorching sands.

WAarox.
Thomson has well imitated this passage :

Retiring from the domis, where, all day long,
They pick’d their scanty fare, a blackening train
Of clamorous rooks thick-urge their weary ssight,
And seek the closing shelter of the grove.
Assiduous, in his bowcr, the wailing owl

Plies his sad song. The cornici-ant, on high,
VVheels from the deep, and screams along the land.
Loud shrieks the soaring bern ς and, with wild using,
The circling sea-sowl clcave the flaky clouds.

SEAsons, iv. ¹39·

According to ΜΓ. Pennant, the elegant bird of
Paradise, which is confined to the Papuan islandis,
and that of New Guinea, exhibits a similar variation
of language. “ then they are surprized with a
strong· gale‚'’ 'says he, “ they instantly soar to a
higher region, beyond the reach of the tempest:
there they float at ease, in the serene sky, on their
light flowing feathers, or pnrsuc their journey in se-
curity. During their ssight, they cry like starlings,
but, in the distress ofa storm blowing in their rear,
they express it by a note resembling the croaking of
ravens.'' Outlines of the Globe, vol. iv.

Ver. Ι 104. And lime-triumphant raven, ] The

longevity of this bird did not escape the knowledge
of our accurate and poetic naturalist. At all times,
and in all countries‚ the raven has been celebrated for
its length of existence 3 and Buffon tells ns, that many
have been known, in different parts of France, to en-

 

ter into their second century. The duration of the
goose ἰῆ, however, equal to that of the raven. Mr.
Willonghby, in hi< Ornithology, tells us, that he hae >
been assur-ed, by the rnost attentive observem of this
bird, that it will live upwards of an hundred years;
and he relates one instance, for the truth of which he
can voueh, ofa goose at fourscore years usage, in
the possession of the fullest health and vigour, having
been designedly killed, “ for her mischievousness in
worrying and destroying the young geese and gos-
lings.” But the longevity of the swan is most re-
markable, if the assertion be true ι it is said, and said
by authors of respectability, that this bird will at
times protract its existence to not less than three cen-
turies: the life of man himself, however, does not cu-
