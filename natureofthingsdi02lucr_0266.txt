DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. V.

Praeterea, pro parte sua, quodquomque alid auget,

Redditur: et, quoniam dubio

Omniparens eadem rerum commune sepulcrum,

procul esse videtur

260

Ergo terra tibi libatur, et aucta recrescit.

Quod super est, humore novo mare, flumina, funteis,

Semper abundare, et latices manare perenneis,

Nihil opus est verbis, magnus decursus aquarum

Undique declarat: sed primum, quidquid aqua’i

265

Tollitur3 in summaque fit, ut nihil humor abundet3

Partim, quod validei, verrentes aequora, ventei

Deminuunt, radiisque retexens aetherius sol:

Partim, quod subter per terras diditur omneis:

Percolatur enirn virus, retroque remanat

Pars etiam glebarum ad diluviem revocatur
Imbribus, et ripas radentia flumina rodunt.

thnever a passage more peculiarly decorated
than the rest,'or an image of inestimable value occurs
in Lucretius, Creech is generally sure to fly over it
without stopping: and yet where the language is
persectly simple and chastc, he will often endeavour
to cmbcllish it either with conceits of his own, or of
some other poet. To translate the latter line of the

present distich he has dragged forth the following
from Cowley :

—the stream with wanton play
Kisses the smiling banks and glidcs away,

and has, in this manner, interwoven Cowley's descrip-
tion with his own version x ⁷

And gentle rivers too with wauton play

That kiss the rocky banks and glide away
Take somewhat still from the ungentle stone
Soften the partS, and make them like their own.

It is astonishing to observe the cqual want of taste
and accuracy of translation that occurs in these
wretched lines. Cowley might tell us undoubtedly,
without the least incongmsty, of a “ stream in wanton
play kissing a smiling bank,” and we may be pleased
with the imagery ; but when this same imagery comes
to be applied to a rocky bank, all its elegance vanishes,
and we pity the rough salute the playsul stream must
have experienced. This is the more unlucky‚ be-
cause the Roman bard himself does not mention, nor
has he any allusion to a νυοί-,γ bank or an ungenlle stone,
neither of which can very easily be sostened or even
abraded; so that the interpreteris as inaccurate as
he is incongruous. Banks, and without any epithet,
is the only term employed in the text. Added to
which, the first line of the Latin couplet is totally
omitted in this eurious paraphrase-
