Boox VI.

THE NATURE OF THINGS.

499

Much, too, the clouds from ocean's restless brine!

Draw ceaseless forth, their airy base to build:

For, as the blood, so fluids all transpire.

490

Thus from each river, e'en from earth itself,

We trace th' ascending moisture, and the mist,

Like vital breath, borne upwards: which, when once

F irmly condens’d, and congregatcd close,

Veil all the heavens with clouds, and darkness deep;

495

While tides of rushing ether closer still

And he adverts to the resemblance, in this respect,
existing between such kind of exhalations‚ and the

fluids of the human body in v. 498. of the same
Book, corresponding to v. 515. of the present
translation ε

pariterque ita crescere utrumque,

Et nubeis, et aquam, quaequomque in nubibus
exstat,

Ut pariter nobis corpus cum sanguine crescit,

Sudor item, atque humor quiquomque cst denique
membris.

 

 

alike augment

XVater and cloud, and all that cloud contains,
As with its frasne augments the vital blood,

Or aught besides of moistuxm· through the limbs.

I have dwelt the longer upon this explanation,
because 1 am under the necessity of deviating from
211 who have preceded me, and have been compelled
to hazard a new interpretation.

Crecch, following the Vienna copy, reads,

Nam ratio cum sanguine abest humoribus omnis ;
And Faber, incapablc of understanding the mean-
ing οἷ the verse, when thus expresse-d. though he
inserts it with this lection in his text, tells us in his
notes, that the entire line ought to be expunged:

a hint which the translators have readily adopted :
for neither Marchetti, De Coutures, Guernier, or

Crecch, have taken the least notice os it.

Not thus Mr. Wakefield: observing the word con-
sanguineas in both the ancient manuscript copies of
Vossius, deposited in the university at Leyden, be
ventures upon a small variation of his own, and, in
his edition, which I have adopted iu the text, ex·
hibits it thus :

Nam ratio consanguinea es! humoribus omnis,

which he explains by the following note: Liquores
salsi, :eque ac dulces, nebulas exhalant augendis :uque
consor-mandis nubibus idoneas. ⁸⁴ sah, as well a·

fresh waters, cxhale rapours lit sor the augmenta-

tion and conformatiun of clouds.'’ l now leave the

rcadcr to determine for himstlt‘.

In the original, v. 480:

Urgnct enim quoquc s'gtiifcri super :ti-cri: atur.

Gassendi explained the fri-ern· ntus to mean. the
strmming radiations qf the um .· aud thu interpreta-
tion has been followed by Marchctti. De Comum,
and Crccch in hi· Englieh version. This last critic,
however, has well obser-ved. in his Latin edition,
which wan publiahed some years after hu translation,
and when he wu better acquainted with lus author.
that the lashing ofthe ray: of the uun must rather
tend to dissolve the incipient cloud than to confirm
and thicken it, aud he immediately gives to the verse
the interpretation contained in the linc before uz. enda
