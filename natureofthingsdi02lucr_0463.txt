‚Boon VI. THE NATURE OF THINGS. 449

When, borne through ether, clouds with clouds contend
By winds adversely driven3 for nought of sound 100
Strikes us where pure the concave ; but where thick
Clouds heap o'er clouds, there, measur’d by their mass,
The deep-ton’d peal with broad'ning bellow roars.
Then less compact their texture than the frame
Of wood or stone, while less diffus‘d by far 10 5
Than the loose web of mistS, or light—wing’d smoke.
For else, like those, plumb downward must they rush
With ssight abrupt, or swift as these dissolve,
Powerless to buoy the measur'd hail or snow.
Then, too, resound they through the sapphire vault, 110
As oft resound the flick'ring curtains drawn
O’er the throng’d theatre from beam to beam.
And oft, to fragments fritterfd by the blast,
Like crackling scrolls they rattle through the skies :
VVhence peals the thunder‚ as the fluttering sheet 1 15
Of parchment crisp‚ or canvas broad unfurl'd‚
Lash'd by the tempest‚ and to tatters torn.
