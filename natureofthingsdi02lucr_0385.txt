witness to the assemblage of large gronps of these,both
morning and evening, in the woods; when one of them
selected for the purpose, after hc had assumed a more
elevated situation, made a signal with his hand for the
rest to be quiet, and began an oration so loud and rapid
as to be heard ataconsiderable distance. Having ceased,
his auditory all reply at the same time, and continue
to do so, till, by another signal, he again commands
silence, resumes his harangue, appears to sum up
what has been said, and to deliver the general opinion ς
after which, the assembly breaks up, and every one
separates himself to whatever pursuit he chuses. If
t'nis be a fact, of which there is much doubt, it
is natural to suppose that the oration and debate are
strictly political, and relate to some common object, as
wellas the best means of prosecuting it with success.
The different accents of the dog and the horse,
when under the influence of the passion of love, and
several others, equally as powerful, are accuratcly
noticed by our zoological poet. The amorous cry
of the elephant is so peculiar that it can never be
:nistaken 3 and one of the most common modes ofen-
snaring this animal when wild, is by instructing a
tame female to make use of it for this purpose. A

, pit-sall, or inclosure, in prepared in a proper place:

she is led to its vicinity, begins the deceitful tale,
and is soon replied to by the first male elephant with-
in hearing; who not only rcplies, but approachts
her, and in his approach is conducted to the snare,
and taken prisoner.

The language of the tyger, leopard, and cat, is
not so rich, or diversified, as that of the dog: but
they have aconaiderable variation in the scale of their
mewings. according to thc predominant passion of
{ear or grief: while these again differ from the ac-
tent of simple pleasure, which cousins in purring,
and very considerably indeed from the loud and dis·

gunting voice os Iove.

The language of birds is, in almost every insum e.
peculiarly musical, whatever be the passion it cmi-
vey: to its variety in,the different tribes ef the ω-
prey, hawk, sea-gull, rook, and raven, our poet i,
bearing testimony in verses that immediately follow.
But the vocabulary os the cock and hen is the mn t
extensive of any with which we are acquainted; or,
perhaps, thia idea merely proceeds from our being
more intimately acquainted with this sowl than uim
any other. The cocle has his watch-word sor an-
nouncing the morning, his love-speech, and his terme
of defiance. The voice of the hen, when she inform,
her paramour that she is disburdened of an egg. u
different from that which acquaints him that the
brood is just hatchcd; and both, again, are widely
different from the loud and rapid eries with which
she undauntedly assails the enemy who would rob
her of her young. Even the little chick, when not
more than four or five days old, exhibits a harsher
and less melodious cluckixvg when offered for foed
what it dislikes, than when it ρεταιν-ες what it
relishes.

The subject is highly tempting, but Ilm-c already
