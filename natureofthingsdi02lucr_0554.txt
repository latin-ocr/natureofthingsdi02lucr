Lm. VI.

Deinde, videre licet, quam multae sint homini res

Acriter infesto sensu, spurcaeque, gravesque.

Arboribus primum certis gravis umbra tributa3

Usque adeo capitis faciant ut saepe dolores,

Si quis eas subter jacuit, prostratuS, in herbis.

Est etiam magnis Heliconis montibus arbos,

Floris odore hominem tetro consueta necare.

Scilicet haec ideo terris ex omnia surgunt,

Multa modis multis multarum semina rerum

Quod permixta gerit tellus, discretaque tradit.

Nocturnumque recens exstinctum lumen, ubi acris

Nidor subfundit nareis, tum cogit ibeidem

Concidere3 ut pronos qui morbus mittere suevit.

Castoreoque gravi mulier sopita recumbit,

But that such venomous kinds of vrgctables might

exist on the sides or summit of mount Helicon, we
can easily conceive, from the existence of similar
kinds in different parts of the world, at {he pre-
sent time. Thus, the Galbad samour of the deserte
of Carmania in Persia, is said to communicate from
its flower such a degree of poisonous odour to the
surrounding atmosphere, that the very wind, as it
flows over it, becomes imbued with the fatal efflu-
viurn, and proves a certain destruction to those who
breatli ir in the vicinity os the shrub. But the blos-
soms of the Mar-,chineel tree of the VVest Indies are
more deleterious still. In the beat of the day it is
dangerous even to touch them, on account of the
molsture which exudcs from their pores; yet it is
even more dangerous to repose beneath them, from
the quantity of farina that falls from their innume-

trunk, after incisions have been made for this pur-
