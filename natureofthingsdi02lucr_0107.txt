THE NATURE OF THINGS.

Oft find we, too, that various frames demand

As various viands; and that what to some

Seems harsh and hateful, some perpetual <leem

Delicious most3 while e'en so vast, at times,

The strange discordance, that what poisons this

To that proves healthful, and prolongates life.

Thus dies the snake that human spittle tastes‚

Work'd into madness, self-destroy'd3 and thus

Wild hellebore, that goats and quails matures,

white, arranged in the Linndan class and order poly-
gamia mona-0123 and the black, denominate-d also
melampodium, to be found under the division of
polyandria polygynia. Both are violent cathartica
when employed on mankind; and hence may, un-
doubtedly, prove fatal in large doses. But the hel-
lebore, more immediately referred to by our poetic
natumlist, is probably the latter, which was the
plant most in estimation among the Greeks aud
Romans. The fact here related by Lucretius is
confirmed by Pliny, with respect to goats a< well
as quailss, lib. x. 12: though, iii another chap-
ter of the same Book. lib. x. 23. he intimates thzit it
was the sceds of the hellcborr. that were most grate-

ful to the tastc of the quail.
Thia justly ccidnaxed iintiinihst also tells us, iii the

equally nutriti-¹1:³3 tri both ordei-s of nniiiiails herc ciiii-

The truth ia. that there is no plant in nature but
affords nutrimcnt to some class of animala or another:
poison is only a relative terni ; :ind nothing is ahso-
liitely and niniven-sully adewinus. The cicuta, which
is thus luxurioiuly feam-d upon by goarii :ind quails,
is cai-efully avoided by horscs :ind ihc human racc:
whilexhc horse, on thc contrary, riots ori the acon-
ite‚ οι· bane-berry, which the gont wiil not touch.

In the same manner, the long-leaved hemlock, which
the cow flius from as a poison, is enjoyed by the
sheep, which avoids in turn the prickly thistle that
the cow feeds upon when it is cut and become flae-
cid. The euphorbia‚ again, or spui-ge, so noxious
to man and most quadrupeds, is greedily devoured by
several of the insect tribes; and the dhamism or In-
dian buceros, fecds to exccss on the colubrina or nux
vomica.

There is an ingenious paper replete with instances
of the same kind, inserted by Mr. Barton in the
AmericanPhilosophicalTransactions, Vol. V. No. ς,
in which the writer notice-³, that the leaves of the
kalmia latifolia, known in the Unitcd states by the
name of laurd, great-laurel, winter-green, spoon-
haunch, and spoon-wood, are caten with impunity by
the decr (cervus Virginianus ofGnielin), and hythe
round-horned clk (cervus wapiti of Damon) ; while
they are poisonoiis to slim-p, to horned caule, and to
horses: in the former of these animals, producing
convulsionis, {naming at the mouth. and death: os
which effects our author adduces undcniablc iz-stanccs.
