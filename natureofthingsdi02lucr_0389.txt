THE NATURE OF THINGS.

E’en with the seasons some, as fame repom,

Change their hoarse accents, as the social rook,

And time—triumphant raven, when for showerS,

Or limpid rills they croak3 or, sultry, pant,

able him to determine on this circumstance with much
precision. A very considerable portion of longe-
vity is also attributed to the eagle3 and Mr. Pennant
mentions one instance of his being possest of a most
remarkable power of sustaining a long abstinence
from food; having, through the neglect of servants,
endured hunger for twenty-one dayS, without any
kind os nutriment whatever. But the toad¹ perhaps,
furnishes us with examples of both these powers, in
a degree superior to that of any other animal. When
tamed, and subject to daily inspection, it is observcd
to be possessed osa great length of years, concern·
ing which a curious fact is related by Mr. Arscott,
in a letter to Mr. Pennant. But it is well known to
have been frequently found alive, and in full healrh,
in the very centre of old full grown oaks and solid
rocks, exactly filling· the cavity in which it lodged,
and without any visible means of acquiring food of
any description. Yet the frog appears ιο rival the
toad in longevity, and perhaps even to exceed it, if
we may credit many accounts published concerning
this reptile. One of the most extraordinary that I
recollect‚ occurs in a History os the American State
ofVermont, by lra Allen, esq.—West, 1798. “ Near
the river Onion,‘' observes this gentleman, “ about
three miles from Burlington-bay‚ in digging a well at
the depth of twenty-four feet, wood was found, and
about thirty froga were discovered, but so apparently
purified, that it was difficult to distinguish them froin
ιο many small stones. When brought out of thc
well, disengaged from the earth, and exposed to the
nir, they gradually felt the vivisying bcams of the
tun, and, to the surprize of all present, lexiped away
with aa much animation aa if they had never lain in
their subterraneous prison. The place where this
vell was mnk was on high ground. often surroundcd
by the river in flood timeo ς large pines. and the an-
cient fragments of them, are found on thia land.

as the subject is, it would occupy too much time to
pursue it from birds to reptiles, and from reptiles to
quadrupeds and fishes. I will only remark, that there
is the atrongest resemblance, uith respect to brevit)-
and longevity of life, between auimalsand vaget-thies.
