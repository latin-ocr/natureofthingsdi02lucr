DE RERUM NATURA.

[ΛΒ. V.

Disjectosque redegit equos, junxitque trementeis:

Inde suum per iter, recreavit cuncta, gubernans;

405

Scilicet, ut veteres Graium cecinere poetae:

Quod procul a verit nimis est ratione repulsum.

Ignis enim superare potest, ubi materiai·

Ex infinito sunt corpora plura coorta:

Inde cadunt vires, aliqua ratione revictae3

410

Aut pereunt res, exustae torrentibus auris.

Humor item quondam coepit superare coortus,

Now with the lamp ⁰s Phallas tlte new dawn
Lighted the world.

 

Ver. 417. rcstrain’d
Abrupt the trembling coursers, rein'd qfresh,]
In like manner Ovid, as Pius observes upon the pas-

sage before us :

Colligit, amentes, et adhuc terrore paventes
Phoebus equos.
Μετ. ii. 398.
The frantie coursers trembling yet with sear,
Phoebus restrains.

Ver. 424. Or the red siroc burn the world to (ΙΨ-1.]
Thus forcibly expressed in the original, ver. 411.

Aut pereunt res, exustae torrentibus auris.

The siroc, or sirocco wind, by which Ῐ have ven-
tured to interpret this passage, must be generally
known by feeling or hearsay to most of my readers,
as an intensely burning blast, periodieally experienced
in great part of Italy aud the Levant, aud blowing
from the south-east over the fiery deserts of Syria,
from which country, indeed, it derives its name—
Siroceo for Syr-iaceo. Milton expressly adverts to it
in the following verses z

Forth rush the Levant and the potent winda

Eurus and Zephyr, with their lateral noise
Sirocchio and Libeechio.j‚

There is a wind somewhat similar, though brisker
in its action, and not quite so intolerable in its beat,
that uniformly succeeds the wet season in Africa,
and takes its direction from the north-east. It is
known to most Europeans by the name of harmattan :
and is accompanied by a thick smoky haze, through
which the sun appears of a dull red colour. ‘⁸ This
wind‚’' says my friend Mr. Park (Travels in the Inte-
rior Districts of Africa) “ in passing over the great
desert of Sabata, acquires a very strong attraction
sor humidity, and parehes up every thing opposed to
its current. lt is, however, reckoned very salutary,
particularly to Europeans, who generally recover
their health during its continuanee. Indeed, the air,
during the rainy season, is so loaded with moisture‚
that clothes, shoes, trunks, and every thing that is
not close to the fire, become damp and mouldy ς and
the inhabitants may be said to live in a sort of vapour-
bath. The ill effects of the harmattan are, that it
produces chaps in the lips, and *affliets many of the
natives with sore eyes.''

Ver. 42 ς. Thus, too, th’ insurgent water-s once ‘o'er-
power’d‚] ,He obviously alludes to the fable
of Deucalion and Pyrrha: and in both this, and the
preceding of Pha'e'ton, is thus followed by Mani-
lius:
Et vomit oceanus pontum, sitiensque resorbet,

Nec sese ipse capit ε sic quondam merserat urbes,
