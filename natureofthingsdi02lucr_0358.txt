Noachic deluge : and that a variety of uew orders of
animals have been created since that epoch. Mr.
Ritu-an, indeed, conceives that not more than those
classes which arc most necessary to the use of man,
were admimd into the ark, aud that these were
He observes
that, at this early period, ravenous animals were not
only unnecessary, but must have been even destruc-
tive to those that had just obtained an existence, and
probably not in great numbers: and that they did
not become requisite till thc graminivorous orders had

multiplied to so great adegree, that their carcases
would have spread infection. Hence he maintains‚
that all the ravenons tribes must have been of poste-
rior creation ; and to this he attributes the existence
of those that are peculiar to America and the torrid
and frigia zones.

But this is merc conjecture! let us support our
poet by an appeal to sober fact. The fossile remains
of anirnals supposed to have been Asiatic, found fre·
quently in Russia and siber-ia, and conceived by
Pallas ·and Gmelin to have appertained to the ele—
phant, are now clearly proved by M. Cuvier to be

those of some other animal, whose species is no
longer discovered alive. The inhabitants of these
countriec„ indeed, believe that the animal still exists,
but that it burrows under the earth, and hence ac-
count sor its invisibility. ln M. Cuvier’s opinion,
this species is probably lost. In the memoirs of the
National Institute (Sciences Phys. et Mat. II.) he
has thus characterised it, Elephas mammonteus,
maxilla obtusiore, lamellis molarium tenuibus rectis.
In the same memoir he enumerates another species of
the same animal, supposed to be lost also, but whose
fossilized bones are detected on the banks of the
Ohio, and in other parts of the American continent.
The character of this last exists thus in M. Cuvier’s
memoir : Elephas Americanus, molaribus multi—cuspi-
dibus, lamellis post detritionem quadrilobatis.—-
Though the fossilized thigh-bone of this animal re-
semble the elephant, M. Daubenton, the late inde-
fatigable colleague of Buffon, thought the teeth
were those of the hippopotamus, and conceived that
the animal partook of both these speciem and was

a real mule—whence, in the language of our poet,
