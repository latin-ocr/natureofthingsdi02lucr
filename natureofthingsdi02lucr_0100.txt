s. DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. IV.

Quod super est, non est mirandum, qua ratione

Per loca, qua nequeunt oculei res cernere apertas,

600

Haec loca per voces veniant, aureisque lacessant: .

Conloquium clusis foribus quoque *saepe videmus.

Nimirum, quia vox per flexa foramina rerum

Incolomis transire potest, simulacra renutant3

Perscinduntur enim, nisi recta foramina tranant :

605

Qualia sunt vitri, species quae transvolat omnis.

Praeterea, parteis in cunctas dividitur vox,

Ex aliis aliae quoniam gignuntur3 ubei nam

ut omne
Humanum genus est avidum nimis auricularum.
Ver. 597,
Which Mr. Hnme has thus quoted and paraphrased.

Ep. on Miracles. “The smallest spark may here
kindle into the greatest flame : because the materials

are always prepared for it. The avidi-:m genus auri-
cularum, the gazing populace, receive greedily, with-
out examination, whatever southes superstition and

 

promotes wonder.”

That the mind, in a state of rui-al solitndc and rc-
tirement from the world, has been led into the belief
of such preternatural existences as are here referred
to, the attentive examiner of nature can easily con-
ceive, and upon grounds which, in a variety ofplaec5‚
are hinted at by our poet himself.

Ver. 616. For voice unhurt through J2'5x1'le rubes
can wind‚] It should seem from this verse,

that the ancients were by no means unacquainted
with speaking-trumpetS, or stentorophonic horus, as
they have been often named, although the invention
be claimed by Moreland, Kircher, and other compe-
titors among the moderns. It is, in corroboration
hereos, an ascertained historic fact, that Alexander
the Great was accustomed to address his army with
some such tube, which conveyed his voice distinctly

to a distance of not less than a hundred furlongs, or
stadia3 as it is also that the Greeks, even prior to
this period, had invented telegraphs, or instruments
for communicating written intelligence to a consider-
able distance, in the same manner as the trumpet of
Alexander communicated oral. The inventor of the
modern telegraph was Don Salvador, D. Coronado, a
native of Spain, and director of the Madrid Observa-
tory. He was at Paris when the first idea occurred to
him, which he followed up with unremitting attention
for four years, from 1786 to 1790. before he publicly
announced it. He admits, however, that he was in-
debted for the basis of his invention to the Grecian
telegraph‚ just referred to, and especially as it was af-
terwards improved by cardinal Ximene& See the ab·
bate Requeno’s Progresos, Pei-dida, y Restablicimien-
to del antiguo arte de trablar desde lejos en la guerra.

It is to the use of these flexile subm, in the science
of acousfics, that we are indcbted‚ in modern days,
for a variety of very curious experiments and effects ι
and especially the spectacle which, under the name of
“ The Invi-‘ille Girl‚” attracted such numerous bodies
of spectators, and excited so much astonishment a few
years ago in the metropolis. The principle upon
which the machine was constructed is clear, and its
application easy. Sound, though heard in all di-
rections, flies with far more energy in a strait line
