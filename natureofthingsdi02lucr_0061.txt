Boox IV. THE NATURE OF THINGS. 49

The part, too, of the semblance that to us 305

The right creates, seems, in the mirror, left:

Hence springs the vision, that when once the film

Strikes on the level radiance, it rebounds

Unalter’d never, by th' elastic blow

In every trait revers'd : as when we dash, 3 10

’Gainst some broad beam, the new-made mask of clay

Soft yet, and pliant, if with front direct

It bear the blow, the hollow frame inverts:

Each feature then transposes, the right eye

Claims the left side, the left the right usurps. 3 15
From mirror, too, to mirror may we spread

The playful image, till its like, with ease,

Be thrice‚ or ampler doubled3 and till nought

Lurk so retir'd, so deep behind, so hid

In tortuous angles, but that many a plate, 320

Rightly dispos'd, may yet through every maze

Drag forth the latent landscape, and at large

E’en in the mansion's central depths display.
