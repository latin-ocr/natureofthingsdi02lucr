DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. IV.

Id, quod jam super-21 tibi saepe obstendimus ante.

Nunc age, quo pacto nareis adjectus odoris

Tangat, agam. Primum, res multas esse necesse est,

Unde fluens volvat varius sc fluctus odorum3

Et flucre, et mitti volgo, spargique, putandum est.

Verum aliis alius magis est animantibus aptus,

Dissimileis propter formas; ideoque per auras

Ver. 689. But come, sor onouas call us, and the

] The
doctrine of taste or geumatics applies‚ without any
variation of consequence, to that of olfaction or
odours. The different construction of animals of
different, and even frequently of the same class, in
the organization of the faculties of taste and smell,
sufficiently accounts for thedisparity of their lik-
ings and antipathies, with respect to these two senses·
The grand object of the second Book was to esta-
blish the principles of this common theory: in the
present, our poet does but little more than apply
them to positive facts; hereby illustrating the ge—
neral phaenomena of external sensation. That the
doctrine inculcated in the subsequent observations
was that of Epicurus, we know from the testimony
of his own words, Diogenes Laertius, x. 53: Και

tween the two senses of smell and taste 3 insomuch‚
that animals without vertebrae, which are destitute of
the offactory membrum, give evident tokens of deriv-
ing some idea o'f smell from the sense cf taste alone.
Genernlly speaking, among all other animis, as the
mamuralia, birds, reptiles, and fishcs, the olfactory
sense appears to exist in proportion to the extent of
the oifucmry membrane; coincidently with which
Blumenbaeh and Socmrncring observed, upon dissec-
tum, that, among mankind, those who were remark-

able for acuteness of smell‚ were possessed of wide,
dilated nostrils, with a broader expansion of mern-
brane than generally appertains to the race. From
his common mode of education, however, and an ha-
bitual exposure to strong odours, to a pzrplexed
combination of odours, and especially from the use of
high—flavoured foods, the sense of smell in man soon
loscs a great proportion ofits keennese and delicacy :
and hence instances of acute olfaction are far more
frequently to be met with, as M. Virey has justly
observed, among savages, than among civilizcd na-
tions. In a state of high and morbid irritability,
however, the sense of smell‚ as well as those of taste
and hearing, acquires, at times, even in civilized life,
an extraordinary degree of vivachy, so as to afflict
the persons who arc thus peculiarly affected. But
almost all other animals, who possess any sense of
smell whatever, possess it in a much stronger degree
than man under any circumstances; an ordination
most replete with wisdom, as it is generally by this
sense that animals are directed in their pnrsuit of
food, and taught what to make choico of, and what
to reject. Almost all the insat-tribes, more parti-
cularly, are gifted with a sense of smell in a very
high degree of perfectiori, and especially the sylphae,
dermestes, nicrophores, and musca vomitoria. Among
birds, the vulture, the owl, the woodcock, and other
aquatic birds, are supposed, by Scarpa, to possess
the greatest acuteness of scent. Few observations
have been made upon fishes, but even these are said,
both by Camper and Monro, to have a very powerful
smellhconsidexing the fluid in which they are immersed;
and, undoubtedly, it must be ⁵0, if, as the latter
