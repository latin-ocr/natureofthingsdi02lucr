DE RERUM NATURA.

Ltn. IV.

Quapropter simulacra pari ratione necesse est

Innumerabile per spatium transcurrere posse

Temporis in puncto: primum, quod parvola caussa .

Est procul a tergo, quae provehat, atque propellat:

Deinde, quod usque adeo textura praedita rarsi

Mittuntur, facile ut quas vis penetrare queant res,

Et quasi permanare per aeris intervallum.

Praeterea, si, quae penitus corpuscula rerum

Ex altoque foras mittuntur, solis utei lux

200

Ac vapor, haec puncto cernuntur labsa diei

Per toturn coeli spatium diffundere sese;

Perque volare mare ac terras, coelumque rigare;

Quod super est, ubi tam volucri levitate feruntur,

Quid, quae sunt igitur jam prima fronte, parata,

O'cr heaven and earth, far as the ranging eye

Can sweep, a dazzling deluge rcigns ς and all,

From pole tff'pole, is undistinguis'd blaze.

And quit the sutfucg’, as the sun's pure tht‚]
The generation of light iu the suu was supposed, by
the schools of Democritus and Epicurus, to be con-
ducted in some such mode as the generationi of vital
ssuids in animals. The sun was conceived to be scd
for this purpose with the pabulum of ether, absorbui
through all its externa} pores, as extraneous matters
are absorbet} by the bibulous mouths of the lympha-
tics in the animal system. The ether {llus absorbui
was, hy a kind of secrctory process, converted into
light, and immediately thrown forth by a system of
exhaling vessels over the whole horizon, as the mat-
ter of perspiration is thrown forth from the human

body. And, perhaps, the fluid of light is actually
secreted in :ome such manner iu the frames of the
glow-worm, fire—fly, and other insecta of the phos-
phoreseent order. Sec Note on Book I. 772. But
in what manner the sun himself is supplied, upon the
Newtonian system, with the means of perpetuating
his own lustre without exhaustion, plrilosophers are
by no means agreed: for, though, as I have already
obstrvcd in the Note on Book 11. v. 166. they are
capable cf measuring the velocity of light; they
have not yet been able to analyse its substance, or to
ascertaiu whether it be simple and elementary, or
compound and mixt. The latter was peculiarly the
opinion of Lucretius, and is indeed supported by
various facts of tlie present day. Among the most
curious and decisive of these, although they have
hitherto been never appealed to upon this subject,
are some late experiments of M. Humboldt inser-ted in
Μ. Mirbcll's Traitz'· d'Anatomie et de Phisiologie Vi·-
