the opening of this Book, to the subject so exqui-
sitely expatiated upon towards the close of the last.
He there traced mankind from their first rude origin
to a state of social life, and followed them in their
progress towards a knowledge of arts and sciences.
He now bursts forth with an appropriate panegyric
upon the city of Athens, in consequence of her having
contributed, more than any other town whatever, to
the general benefit and happiness of human-kind.
She it was, he informs us, who first instructed them
in agriculture, and political economy: she it was
who illuminated the mind as amply as she provided
for the body: and, finally. she it was vrho gave
birth to the illustrious author of that excellent and
comprehensive system of philosophy, which it is the
uniform object of the Poern to explain. That the
first knowledge of agriculture in Greece was derived
from the Athenians, was a position universally ad-
mitted both in Grecce and Rome ; as it was, also, that
religion and social order had their earliest origin
among this extraordinary people. Thus Cicero,
pro Phoc. Ab Athenis enim humanitas, doctrina,
religio, fruges, jura, leges, orta, atque in ornnes ter-

ras distributa putantur. “ It is acknowledged, that

literature, polite arts, religion, agriculture, lawe,
and social rights, originated in Athens, and were
thence distributed over all nations.'’ To the same
effect, Diod. Sic. lib. xiii. Plin. vii. 56. Justin.
lib. ii. But to whom are the Athenians indebted
sor their first advance towards this acquaintance with
literature and polite arts? In the Note, Book V.
v. 1483· 1 have observed, that the first knowledge
of letters, and consequently the elements of all lite-
rature in Greece, were derived from Phcenicia, and
probably through the medium of Egypt. Cecrops
has the honour of having led the first, or one of the
first colonies of this eventful country. But who
this Cecrops was, or, rather, at what period he
lived, is extremely doubtful. In the chronology of
the Grecian annalists, we meet with two monarchs
of this name, the one who is represented as the
earliest king of Athens, and who existed not less
than 780 years anterior to the Olympiads—and the
other who did not ascend the Athenian throne till
225 years later, having been preceded by cranaus,
the direct successor of Cecrops I. Amphic-
tyon, Erecthonius, Pandion I. and Erectheus. Iu·
