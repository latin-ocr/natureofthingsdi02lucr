This argument against the eternity of the world, and
an infinite series of successions in animal life, so stre-
nuously contendesl sor by Aristode, is strictly logical
and impressive. Macrobius has copied, and expanded
it in his book on the Dream of Scipio, ii. ιο. Quis
non hinc existimet mundum quandoque coepisse, nec
longam retro hujus aetatem, Sec. “ Who can believe
otherwise than that the world bad a beginning, and
that, too, not long anterior to the present age, since
we have no Grecian narrative of any thing, not even
of splendid actions, and events that occurred earlier
than two thousand years ago? Nothing worthy of
notice, indeed, is recorded in any volume prior to
the reign of Ninus, who is, by some, supposed to

had existed from the beginning, or, in the language
of the philosophers, even before the beginning, why,

the memory of things? and why are some nations,
even at this day, scarcely initiated into the know-
ledge of a variety of useful facts? Even the Gauls
knew nothing of the cultivation of vines and olives
till after Rome had acquired the full vigour of her
youth: and other people, even at this moment, are
totally ignorant of the most common and beneficial
inventions among ourselves: arguments that seem
strongly to contradict the eternity of things, and
conipd us to believe, that the world itself had a de—
sinite origin, and that all we are acquainted with
arose progressively afterwards.'’

But it seems, we know more of these antique re-
cords now than was known two thousand years ago :
though not a single archive has been since detected,
nor an additional datum of any kind fallen acciden-
tally into our possession. The marquis de Boufflers
lias given it as liis opinion, in a very elegant and spi-
rited essay (Discours sur la Litterature) delivered in

the Acadcmy of Sciences and Belles Lettres at Ber-
lin, August 9, 1798, that there have been arta and
seiences invented, and splendid actions and heroic vir-
tues exhibited, of which we have now no conception,
in periods of time long anterior to the first records of

existing history: and that even Homer and Pindar-
were preceded by writers who excelled thern as much
as these poets have surpassed their successors. This

may be an ingenious conjecture, but the illustrious
orator might as well have amused his audience with
speculations concerning the inhabitants of the moon,
the exploits of her heroes, and the talents of her
bards and philosophers. In direct opposition to
this exuberance of sut-mise, Ι have already observed,
in Note on Book 1. v. 517. that Mr. Bryant will not
allow the existence even of the Ti‘ojan war itsclf‚
and certainly, therefore, not of the Theban, to
which our poet also refers, and which, if it occurred
at all, must have occurred at a period anterior still;
contending, at least with respect to the Trojan war,
that it has no foundation in real history, and that all
the celebrated heroes engaged in it, the glorious
battles that were fought, and the eloquent speeches
that were uttered, are equally creatores of the ima-
gination ε phantasms that, on tlie first touch of the
lthurial spear of philosophie inquiry‚ vanish into
emptiness‚ and “ leave not a rack behind.''

Before I close this Note, 1 cannot avoid noticing,
that this passage of our poet furnishes us with a corn-
plete datum as to the earliest aera to which the long
lost Epic Cycle of Greece could extend, indepen-
dently of the mere traditionary fables recorded in it.
This celebrated collection of all the eruditiori of anti-
quity, whether historic or mythologie, is well known
to have been ofvery high antiquity, though we are now
ignorant both of its author, and of tlie age in which it
was written. It was, doubtless, however, in existence
long aster, as well as before the time of Lucretius;
for we find it referred to by Horace, (De Arte Poet.
v. 136.) and have great reason to suppose, that
Statius drew from this metrical history the plan for

his Thebaid. M. Heyne, indeed, Excurs. ad lib. ii.
