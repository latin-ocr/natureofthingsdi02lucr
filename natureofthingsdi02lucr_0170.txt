which is not of very modern date. Ducange makes
express mention of such mills in the twelsth century 3
and they were probably known at a much earlier
aera. This,at least, is certain, that the ancients were
sufficiently acquainted with the ait of working differ-
and the banks
of their rivers not only abounded with {imur-mills,

but with mills for the purpose of working their saws,
in the division of stone and rough marble. Thus
much we may colle& from Ausonius, who in ad-
verting to the Embms, which emptitd itself in the
Moselle, speaks of it as

- The ancients were not only acquainted with the art
of milling cloths, but also with that of fabricating
telts; that is to say, thick and hard substances,
which are neither spun, warped, or woven : but com-
posed of hair or wool confusedly intermingled, and
which acquire consistence by means of their being
squeezed and pressed. This operation precisely re-
sembled that of our modern hatters3 nor can we, in
any other way, understand the following passage of
Pliny: Lana: et per se coactam vestem faciunt: ct

si addatur acetum, etiam ferro resistunt. ‘⁴ KVools.

impacted dress; but if vinegar be added, they will.
even resist the sword.’' Instead of vinegar, our
own hatters employ acids ofa different kind, in the
bath in which they press their materials. Felt, in-
deed, was not unknown to the Greeks, and is by
Thucydides (lib. iv.) denominated πιλημαι : they even
made breast-plates ofit for their soldiersz and it is
to this fact, probably, that Pliny allodes, when as-
serting, in the passage above, that it was capable of
resisting the edge or point of the sword. It is by
no means improbable, however, that the hats or hel-
mets of the Cre-cion and Roman soldiers were occa-
sionally manufactured from the same substance.

The giving nap to stuffs was also a branch of the

from these tei-ms. The French have hardly a term
that will correspond with 1t, for le poi! applies indis-
criminately to hair, beard, and wool, previous to their
sustaining any manufacture; and luitur, to wool, or
mal-s woolisy, is the common verb which they employ
to express the operation of napping, or raising the
nup. The napper himself was by the Greeks de-
noniinated γναφευς, and the tool with which he ope-
rated γναφος. As to the form of thiu. instrument, the
greater part of ancient writers agree in representing
it as furnished with points or thorns ; and an expres-
sion of Plato, ολκη γναφεως, (the napper’s drawer,
vellicator, or instrument that draws the nap out-
wards, or towards himself,) seems to imply that those
points or thorus were incurvated. Originally, it ap-
pears to have been nothing more than a bundle of
thorus or thistles dexteronsly twisted together. The
word ymmo,- is therefore thus interpreted by the scho-
liast upon Aristophanes, εστι δε ava-29:⁹3& τι 9¹ ξυουσι

manner not very different by Suidas and Hesychius,
