for the purpose. At length, as we are farther told,
these wretched hirelings were either destroyed by
their dangerous occupatiori, or relinquished it from a
sear of destruction, or in consequence of their having

completely filled the public graves appointed by the ma-
gistrates of the city. The funeral rites of the deceased

now, therefore, depended upon their surviving friends
alone; and, too much depressed by grief, or exhausted
by disease, to dig a grave or raise a pyre with their
own hands, in the extremity of despair, they often
endeavoured to seize, by force, the pyres which were
erected for strangers.

The “ vehement voci eration,'’ referred to in the
text, is, by many annotators‚ attributed to their con-
tention for the funeral pile: yet it rather refers, l
think, to those violent outcries and lamentatione. which
were uniformly poured forth by the common people
over their deceased friends during these superstitious
solemnities ς and were often accompanied with extra-
vagant gesticulations and voluntary tor-tures.—The
dirges, or funeral orations, delivered over the tomb·

author himself has furnished ns, in this passage in the
third Book, with a specimen which has never been
exceeded. Nardins has written a treatise of some
length upon this very specimen; in which, with
much trnth and erudition, he has deu-loped the entire
history of funeral solt-munies a> praetised among the
Athenians. Thosc, who are anxious for fuller inform-
ation upon [lais interesting subject. may petuse
him with an eqnal degree os amusement and satis-

sat-tion.
