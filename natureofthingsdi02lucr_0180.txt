166 DE RERUM NATURA.

Aut alio possis animi traducere motus,

Lm. IV.

1065

Nec Veneris fructu caret is, qui vitat amorem3

Sed potius, quae sunt sine Ροεηῖι, conmoda sumit.·

Nam certe pura est sanis magis inde voluptas,

Quam miseris: et enim potiundi tempore in ipso

Fluctuat incertis erroribus ardor amantum:

1070

Nec constat, quid primum oeulis manibusque fruantur.

Quod petiere, premunt arte; faciuntque dolorem

Corporis, et denteis inlidunt saepe labellis,

Osculaque adfligunt, quia non est pura voluptas:

Et stimulei subsunt, quei instigant laedere id ipsum,

1075

Quodquomque est, rabies unde illaec germina turguent.

Sed leviter poenas frangit Venus inter amorem,

m

Le fresche piaghe non risani, e volgi
Dell’ alma afflitta in altra parte i moti.

 

Ver. 1 100. the pure of heare

Far surer phasur-es, and qfnobler [ὠμὴ] So,

Thomson :

But happy they ἓ the lmppiest of their kind ἔ
Whom gentler stars unite ς and ln one sate

Their beans, their fortuues, and their beings
blend. Smuuc, 1110.

To the same efflet, Milton, in verses too forcibl:
to be omitted. though too beautiful not to be gene-

rally known :

Hm wedded love ! mysterious law, true source
Of human offspring, bole propricty

In paradise of all things common else.

By thee adulter-ons lust was driv’n from men
Among the bestia! herds to range ; by thee,
Founded in reason, loyal‚ just, and pure,
Relations dean and all the charities

Of father, son, and brother, first were known.
Far be it that 1 should write thee sin or blame,
Or think thee unbefitting lxoliest place,
Perpetua] fountain of domestic sweets !

those bed is undefil’d, and chaste prononnc'd,
Present, or past, aa saints and patriarchs us'd.
Herc love his golden slrafts employs, here lights
His constant lamp, and waves his purple wings :
szgns here and revels 3 not in the bought zmile
Of harlots, lovelcss‚ jaff-less, unindear’d,

Cx ule fruition.
