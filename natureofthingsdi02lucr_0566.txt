rs, perhaps, a more extraordinary phaenomenon than
that of alternating hot springs. The account is
confirmed, however, by Pliny, who adds, that it was
situated near the temple erected to Jupiter at Dodona,
ii. ¹³3· “ In Dodone Jovis autem fons, curn sit ge-
lidus, et immersas faces extinguat, si extinctae admo-
veantur, accendit.'' But this is not the only foun-
tain of this nature of which Pliny makes mention;
sor iu lib. xxxi. 2. he enumerares two more, the one
in India denominated Lycos; and the other at Ec-
batana, which is in like manner described by Solinus.
Such may have existed, for any thing we can affirm
to the contrary, and nur author-'s reasoning upon the
nature of their operations is at least consistent and in-
genious. Even in modern chemistry, the approxi-
mation of different substances, that are highly charged
with latent or elementary sire, thefi1·e-seeds of Lucre-
tius, although sensibly cold to the touch prior to
their comam. will occasionally produce the effect
here delineated‚ and burst forth into the most sur-

 

vegetable oils with highly concentrated mineral acida,
especially those of nitre and viti-iol, than by the union
of any other substances.

The springs here spoken of, consisted, in all
probability, of pure liquid bitumen3 or, if not, of
springs on the surface of which liquid bitumen floated
in large quantities. Such are by no means unfre-
quent both in our own country and abroad: the most
remarkable, perhaps, among ourselves, is that at
Pitchford in Shropshire, where the bituminous fluid
bubbles forth from the earth like a sountain. In
Italy they are more common still ; and very general
in the island of Barbadoes. But the most extra-
ordinary bituminous springs, of which we have any
account, are in the Birman empire. In the province
of Ari-acan, major Symes met with a considerable
clustre of them, the depth of whose wells was about
thirty-seven fathoms, and the column of oil contained
in them generally as high as the waist of those who
descended for the purpose of collecting it. The
Lycos of Pliny, which, as just observed, he places
in ludia, was probably one of these very fountains.
