Boox VI. , THE NATURE OF TIIINGS. :323

O'er every limb should trail his serpent sires Ρ
Here nought lurks wond'rous: for from various seeds 68 5
Spring they, confest, in various modes combin'd;
While heaven and earth alone such seeds adverse
Amply supply to rear the tyrant ill.—
Deem, then, alike, that heaven and earth themselves
Draw from the boundless whole the stores evinc’d 690
When, with wild horror, quakes the world abrupt3
O’er earth and main when rushing whirlwinds sweep.
'Or heaven inflames with fires from AETNA thrown.
For heaven thus blazes from the seeds of fise
Countless collected, as the pond’rous storm 695
F alls in full shower when aqueous atoms throng.
“ But far too vast the sparkling deluge pour'd !’'
And vast alike to him the stream must How,
In earlier life who ne'er so vast has seen ε
And vast >each tree‚ each sentient tribe, and all 700
Till now ne’er witness'd; while each sight so vast,
While heaven, earth, main, united ne'er augment
The boundless compass of th' unbounded whole.
