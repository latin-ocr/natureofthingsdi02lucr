as Ι have already observ-ed, first began to sprout
forth, which occupied the third day, or period
of the scalt· by which hc has admeasured the work
of creation. During the fourth, so great was
the perpetual efflux of ether and caloric, that the lu-
ininaries of heaven were complcted‚ and commeneed
their carcer. And the fifth was devoted to the pro-
duction of fishes and fowls.

It must be remarked that, in the strict letter of
the Mosaic history, although both fishes and fowls
are stated to have been created within the same pe-
riod or division of time, the term fishes occurs first ε
and all our most celebrated modern geologists‚ from
an intimate examination of the structure of the earth,
so far as they have been able to penetrate into its in-
terior, concur in maintaining that fishes must inevi-
tably have had the precedence. Such is the doc-
trine of Buffon and Baillie, of Whitehurst and Kir-
wan: and such also, for any thing we know to the
contrary, may have been the opinion of Lucretiua;
yet such, at the same time, is the poetic precipi-
tancy with which he is hurried forwards in his de-
scription of this sublime and stupendous subject, or
rather, perhapS, such the comparative ignorance of
his own age, and of every succeeding‚ with respect to
the different tribes of fishes, that he makes no mention
of this order of animals whatsoever. Buffon and
Whitehurst affirm that they must have existed first in
the order os creation, and that for many ages; be-
cause they were competent to exist even before the
summits of the lostiest mountains were exsiccated;
and more especially because chaus-stone, or calcareous
earth is not, according to their opinion, a primitive
substance, but the mere exuviae of testaceous fishes,
however largely and loftily it may be discovered. Yet
it has been amply ascertained of late that neither
fishes, 1:01· animals of any description, can generate
calcat-eous earth by any organic power whatever: and
that in every instance where it has issued from
them, it lias¹ been a mere deposit or secretion, in

consequence of their havi-ng lived upon food combined
with calcareous molecules. This is particularly in-
sistcd upon by Mr. Kirwan, and indeed forms one of

the most prominent differ-encres of his theory from
that of Mr. 'Whitehurst : the former contending‚ that

calcareous earth is as truly primitive as silex, argil, or
any of the other seven, that are generally admitted as
such; and which he thus arranges, according to the
quantities in which they are proportionably found3
siliacus, ferruginous, argillaceous, calcar-eous, magne-
siambarytic, Scottish, and Japonic. But Mr. Kirwan
himself, nevertheless‚ from the detection of the exuviae
of fishes upon the summit of mountains of almost every
height and climate that do not exceed, and there are
few that do exceed it, eight thousand five hundred
feet above the level of the ocean, equally contende
that fishes must have been created long anterior to
every other animal tribe ς and of fishes, the testaceous
classes first, as being better able to subsist in rnuddy
water. Above the height, however, of eight thousand
five hundred feet from the level of the ocean, shells
and other remains of fishes are never found3 and he
apprehends, therefore, that the chaotic fluid must
have subsided to this depth before even the formation
of fishes themselves. Yet upon this theory there is no
reason why the tribes of birds might not have been cre-
ated anterior to fishes ; for the summits of several very
extensive chains of mountains must,at this period, have
been perfectly dry, and covered with vegetable food.
It is not, however, to be wondered at, that .

the ancients were not much acquainted with the
history of fishes: for ichthyology has not become.
even in our own day, a very favourite science;
and there is no part of natural history that has been
less profoundly explored. Artedi, who was, per-
hapS, more attached to it than any modern philoso-
pher whatever, and bid fairest to advance it to some
degree os perfection‚ died whilst he was arranging his
system. His friend Linneus appears at one time to
have determined upon adopting the same system, but
