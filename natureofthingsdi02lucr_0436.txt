v. 1048. As to the art of typography, or the mode
of expressing ideas by arbitraiy symbols, it is of
much more difficult research. The knowledge of
letters is asserted by many grammarians and phi-
losophers, Pagan, Jewish, and Christian, to have
been immediately communicated by the Supreme
Being to mankind. But this assertionis, in the first
place, mere conjecture, and secondly, incongruous'
with that exertion of the natural powers of man,
which seems to be expected of him by his Creator,
and for which such powers were unquestionably

was miraculous, it is absolutely necessary to demon-
strate that the faculties of the human mind are in-
competcnt to such inventious; for, if they he com-
petent of themselves, we may rest perfectly satisfied
that the Almiglity never immediately interfered to
inform us of either. Throughout the whole extent
of sacred history there is no instance of the perform—
ance of a miraclc, when the effect to be produced was
capable of baing acccotnplished by natural means.
Admitting‚ then, with our poet, that written or vi-
sible lauguage, as well as audible or oral‚ is ot' human
invention alone‚-—tbe next question that accosts us is,
whether the alpliabetic elements or characters em-

ployed by different nations have proceeded from one
common stock ?--and, if the affirmative be true,
whether this common stock consisted of arbitrary
symbols like our own, or of hieroglyphics, which
are pictures or imitative representations of the natural
attributes of things ἒ On the first discovery of South
America, of China, and of the Friendly Islands, the
inhabitants of all these different countries were found
to communicate their ideas by the latter medium;
and from the accordance and high antiquity which
must hence, of necessity, be acet-ded to it, picture·
writing, or hieroglyphics‚ have been allowed the
prior-ity of invention by perhaps the greater number
of inquirers, and especially by our learned and in-
genious countryman‚ Mr. Astle, who has lately pur-
sued this subject with indefatigable‚ and, in many re·
spects, the most successful attention.

To myself these two modes of visibly expressing
our ideas appear to have little or no connexion, and
especially no such connexion as that ofcause and effect.
In other words, alphabetie elements do not appear to
me to have flowed necessarily from hieroglyphics, or
hieroglyphics from alphabetic elements. They are two
distinct inventions for the same purpose, to which dis.
ferent nations have been led by accident z among some
the firsthaving been adopte‹l‚amongothers the second3
while among others, again, as the Egyptians and Chi-
nese‚both have been equallyemployed‚—and thatwitb-
out any mixture of the two modes whatever. On this
account, also, it appears to me, contrary, indeed, to
the opinion of Mr. Astle, that arbitrary symbols, as
being by sar the simplest contrivance for assisting
the memor-y, anteceded the use of pictures or hiero·
