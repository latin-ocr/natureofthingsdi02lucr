DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. VI.

PostremO, quur sancta defim delubra, suasque

Discutit infesto praeclaras fulmine sedes;

Et bene facta defirn frangit simulacra, suisque

Demit imaginibus violento volnere honorem?

Altaque quur plerumque petit loca3 plurima quo plus

Montibus in summis vestigia cernimus ignis?

Quod super est, facul est ex hiis cognoscere rebus,

Πρηστηρας Graiei quos ab re nominitarunt,

Ver. 43 3.
Thus Horace:

Decidunt turres, feriuntque summos

--—-and mountain: mos! sublime ἒ]

Fulmina montes.
on. ii. ιο.

Down falls the tower beneath the fatal flash,
The mountains hear, and tremble at the crash.

Ver. 434. Hence, with much ease, the meteor may

Tum‘d, from its essence, Paris-rsa by the
Canem] Having discussed the phaeno-
menon of thunder and lightning, he now proceeds
to consider those of the water-spout‚ and the hurri-
cane: and it is truly curions to observe how mi-
nntely he concurs with the philosophy of the present
day, in regarding them as meteors of a similar nature
and origin. Prester, indeed, as our poet informs
u3‚is a Grtck word signifying a lie-ry or inflammatory
intumescence ς and such, he asserts, is the essencc of
which this meteor (the water-sporn) consists : whence
it is obvious, that the term ventus, or wind, applied to
it immediately afterwards, is employed generically,
to express an clastic gass or ether, for which Lu-
cretius found no desinite expression in his own lan-
gnage, rather than the nature of wind properly so
called. It is an igneons ‹ir ficry aura, not indeed in
the open act of combiistion, but composed of the
fines-t and most minute particles of a pccnliar species

of elementary fire, which, in a more concentrated

form, would necessarily become luminous and escha-
I'OUC·

Gassendi, indeed, contends, that the Epicurean
prester is not an igneous memor, but a mere vortex
of elastic air. But there can be no doubt of his
being mistaken; sor Lucretius not only employs a
term to which fire, in some modification οι· other,
either elementary or combined, is necessarily at·
tached, but refers us, in the opening of the discus-
sion, by way of explanation, to the constituent par·
ticles of lightning, which, he expressly declares,
consist of the very finest and most attenuate fiery
atoms.

Fiery, too, and of the common essence of light-
ning is this meteor asserted to be, by the philosophy
of the present day. For it is regarded as an electrical
phaenomenon3 as, indeed, is almost every atmo-
spherical mereor, as well as a great variety that are
subterraneons. In describing the powers and opera-
tion of the thunder-cloud in Note on v. 2 56. above,
1 have noticed its wonderful faculty of atti-acting‚
with almost instantaneous speed‚ the lighter and
adscititious clouds in its vicinity‚ as I have also
its submission to the still more strongly attractive
power of that part of the earth which lies immedi-
ately beneath it, in a state of negative electricity‚
evidenced by its dipping downwards either in ragged
and multisona fragments, or, where the film of the
