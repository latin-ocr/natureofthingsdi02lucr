DE RERUM NATURA.

liat Β. IV.

Et commiscendo quomsemine forte virili

Femina vim vicit subita vi, conripuitque3

Ver. 25. It is well observa-d by Schultens, that the
verb ων), is commonly¹ appropriated to the action of
a restive and* violent horse, not nuder the command
of his czxrb, aud is hence much more emphatically
rendered plunge, than, as in our common version, de-
cline. fll'fl] refers rather to an armed or sortified
way than to a pall) or way generally-3 and hence
the word bonndart'es, by'whieh l have rendered it,
best agrees with the cnsning verse.

Chap. vi. 27. see Note on v. 1179.oi·' the pre-
sent Book.

Chap- v· 9. T'ne best commentat-y upon the
passage extending from this verse to ¹4· is the pa-
rable of the repentant prodigal, Lukc xv. 1 t. and
it requires no farther illustration.

Ver. 21. “ Eehold ! the ways of such a man, &c.’'
In our common version, “ For the way8‚ &c.'' I am
indebted to Reiske for the first glauce at this mean-
ing of the Hebrew ⁹2, which 1 have rendered in the
sume manner in ch. vii. 19. The term is of very ex-
tensive signification, and Noldius has given not less
than three and thirty senscs in which it is occasion-
ally used, without, in the remotes-t degree, adverting
to the present. lt explains, however, better than
any other, a variety of passages in the sacred Scrip-
tures, anfi, iu some, appears absolutely necessary.
Thus, Job iii. 24. 25:

san ’nnis *emb ⁹:2²> ⁹:
1'5'7332‘ ΞΨΖ] ῚΣΓῩἹ
’.ΣΤῚΝἾ ’ΠἾΠΞἙ ἿΓἾΞ ’2
·: ’ἴτ’ Μ’ ’rs-³2⁹ *iwan
nmmo! my sighing takes the place of my sood,
And my lamentations burst forth as the billum-s:

manto! the terror which Ι sear rushes upon me,

And that which I dread is ‘⁶ still’' at hand.

lt is hence obvious, that ⁹2 is sometimes of pa-
rallel meaning with ῙΠ, and many passages in
lsaiah, as well as other parts of holy mit, might be
rendered either more forcible or more perspicimus by
such an interpretation. See, among others, Isaiah,
cli. xxi. 6.15‚16‚ 17.

 

Ver. 1264. U, when the male his genia! eide protrudes,]
We now commence a subject on which, notwithstand-
ing all the new opinions that have been hazarded, and
the very great advantages which have accrued to me-
dical science in general, from our present improved

knowledge of anatomy, little has been added to the
common stock of information prevalent in the aera of

Lucretius. On the contrary, we may contend, that
although a complete cycle of theories has not altoge-
ther taken place, very little remains to make it per·-
fcct z the unfounded and indigested systems of inter-
vening ages have progressively vanished away, and
we seem this moment falling back to the very creed of
Epicurus, as developcd in the numbers of his harmo-
nious disciple: a creed not large-ly differing indeed

from that of Hippocrates, who preceded Epicurus by ‚

five centuries at the least.

Omitting an infinite variety of offsets and abortive
systems which have been generated, and have existed
for a short time, from this fertile subject, there are
three that deserve our particular attention 3 that con-N
tended for by Lueretius, that the animal, or rather
the human fetus, for we are now principally bending
our attention to our own species, is the conjoint pro-
duction of seminal matter afforded in coition by
both sexes, which has been tei-med the theory of
epig-*wesin that which asserts that the female alone
affords the basis of the embryon 3 and that which af'·
firms it to bc the total productiori of the male ; both
which latter have been denominated theories of
evolution.

The second hypothesis in the present arrange-
ment, or that contending for the productiori of the
fetus from female rudimenta alone, was originally ad-
vanced by josephus de Aromatariis ; but it was prin-
cipally brought into notice by Swammerdam and
Harvey. Observing. a vast cluster of vesicles in the
female ovarium, an organ situated on each side of the
uterus or womb, and in its immediate vicinity‚ though
only mediately connected with it by means of the
Fallopian tube and vasa deferenti33 and perceiving
that thece vesicles appeared to diminieh in number, in
