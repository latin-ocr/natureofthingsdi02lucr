DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. V.

Inde aliae Tempestates, Venteique‚ sequuntur;

Altitonans Volturnus, et Auster fulmine pollens.

Tandem Bruma niveis adfert, pigrumque rigorem

Reddit3 Hyems sequitur, crepitans ac dentibus Algu.

Quo minus est mirum, si certo tempore luna

Gignitur‚ et certo deletur tempore rursus;

Quom fieri possint tam certo tempore multa.

Solis item quoque defectus, lunaeque latebras,

Pluribus e caussis fieri tibi posse putandum est.

Nam, quur luna queat terram secludere, posciS‚

Lumine, et a terris altum caput obstruere ei,

Objiciens caecum radiis ardentibus orbem?

Tempore eodem aliud facere id non posse putetur

And diist-discolour'd Summer, with ripe suns
Concocts th’ inactive greensward.

Ver. 764. Com shuts the scene, and VVrnrea’s
train prevails‚
Snows, hoary ὃιεετ, and Faosr with chat-
ecring mlh] The whole of this exquisite
delineation of the progress of the seasons is, I be-
lieve, inimitable. Almost every idea is personified‚
and every syllable alive: the order is most exact, and
the characters true to themselves. There are few
descriptions, either in ancient or modern poetry,
that can dare a comparison with it. l will select,
however, the following, of Thomson. He is ad-
dressing the sun ι

 

round thy beaming car,

High-seen‚ the Snsous lead in sprightly dance
Harmonious knit, the rosy·finger’d hours ι

The Zzpnvas floatingloose3 the timely Rmus ς
Of bloom etherial the light-footed DEws ;
And softened into joy the surly Sronms.

Summa ii. 120.

This is elegant, but the painting wants a force
and relief which the picture of Lucretius possesses in
a high degree. It is too general to be discriminata
and not a single Smsou is delineated characteristi-
cally.

Ver. 769. Thus, too, to various causes may’st thou
Charge

‘The sun's eclipse, or shade os lunar light]

The same diversity of causes was equally admitted by
Epicurus, or rather he was equally undetermined
which of them to select as an opemtiug principle, as
we learn from Diogenes Laertius, x. 96. λεγει, says
he, of this philosopher, και τοι ἠλι
