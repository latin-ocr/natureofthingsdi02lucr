these mirrors are so disposed and multiplied as to
throw them upon the hangings of the rooms, like so
many moving pictures.

mirrors are more multiplied, so as to introduce the
picture into the interior of the room, no such dis-
tinction is necessary. It is probably to some such
fashion, prevalent in his own age, that the poet al-

our opinion of the theory of catoptrics among the
Greeks and Romans, their practical knowledge of
the science cannot but excite our surprize, and must
have been far greater than is generally acceded to
them. The poet here proceeds to the description
of the cylindrical minor, which certainly implies a
knowledge of the convex and its proper-ties, and
most probably includes that of the concavc and sphe-
rical. The phaenomenon here represented will, not
occur in every species of cylindrieal speculum, bnt
only in those of certain proportions; it may, alm,
be exhibited in concave specula, where the propor-
tions are, in like manner, varied for the purpose.
Eut for the relative properties of these peculiar or-
ders, as well as for the general canon by which such
problems are resolved, upon the modern system, I

 

must refer to express treatises on optics‚ in which
these subjects are necessarily discusse-d at large.

12 was not, however, to the philosophy of light,
skatte, and colours alone, that the aucients directed

their attention. They made a practical use of them
in the elegant arts of designing and painting‚ in all
the different branches of which they acquired a de-
gree of perfection which may well vie with that of
later ages. Those who have studied the history of
these arts, as succinctly but satisfactorily compiled by
Pliny, must be convinced, that there is scarcely a
style of modern drawing or colouring which was not
known to the Greeks ς who united to these exquisite
accomplishments all the collateral ramifications of
embroidcry, tapestry, brocading, damaskwork, in
the time of Homer denominated εμπαιστα, and every
species of mosaic, which, according to thc Roman
annalist, had a different denomination assigned to
each. Thus, we meet with one set of arranged and
coloured stones which was called lithostrata; ano-
ther, opus tesselatum; a third, musivum; a fourth,
emblematicum ς and a fifth, vermiculatum5 many of
several kinds of which are still carefully preserved in
St. Peter's church at Rome, and contribute, in no
small degree, to the splendour of that magnificent
edilice. Their inlaid works, however, were not
confined to stone and marble3 they extended to
horn, tornoise-shell, and ivory : and Pliny makes ex-
press mention of several exquisite proofs of their
taste and ingenuity in inlaying tables, and other
furniture, with a mixture of ivory, and woods or
barks differently coloured, so as to produce the ef-
fect οἱ a finished picture or medallion.

From whom the Greeks derived their first know-
ledge of designing wc know not. According· to-
Pliny, Telephanes of Sicyon and Ardices of Co-
rinth equally contended for the honour: but the
species of design hc first adverts to, an invention, in-
deed, prior to any aera that can be ascribed to these*
artists. is the rude and incondite methodos tracing
