THE NATURE OF THINGS.

325

Wag’d endless war, or this than that addue'd

Proofs more conclusive to th’ unbiass'd mind.

Why too may not each rising moon be new Β

Its time, form, place, by nicest order sway’d‚

And, springing daily‚ daily too decay,

Still reproduc’d for ever? this to solve

Both words and reasoning arduous find alike,

Since things throughout in order How precise.

SPRING comes, and VENUs, and, with foot advane’d,

The light-wing'd ZEPHYR‚ harbinger belov’d‚

Maternal F LORA strewing, ere she treads,

O'er every footstep blooms of choicest hue,

And the glad ETHER loading with perfumes.

Then HEAT succeedS‚ the parch'd ETESIAN breeze,

And dust-discolour'd CERES ; AUTUMN, then,

“ Now had the boisterous merza deputed, and
the Sumo, in all her gmees, had revisited the earth.
The sace of the mcadows was painted with colours
by the finger-s of the Deity‚ as though the dyer had
oprinkled them with his hucs; and the fair bride of
the gar-den was decoratcd by heavenly XVrsnom, and
beautifully attin-cd, as by a jeweller. The birds
chirupped among the bowcrs: a hundred nightingales,
a thousand linnets assaumd the ear, arrested the at-
tention, and tranquissizcd al} nature with the §wect-
ness of their carols : while the footsteps of divine bc-
nevolencc recallcd the carth into life from its grave of
dissolution.”
