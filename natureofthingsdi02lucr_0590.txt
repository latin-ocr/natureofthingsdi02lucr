reality this earth be not secreted from their own

bodies by express organs for the occasion. And
hence the equal facility with which quai-ries of grits,
griffites, breccias, and other ear-tha, are formed' in
places where the sea-water has a free access to such
substance-s. We learn from Saussure, that in the
neighbourhood of Messina‚ where grits are quarried
near the sea, the excavations produced by their re-
moval are soon filled with sea-saud, the particles of
which are in a few years agglutinatcd into the most
rigid state of solidification by the calcareous matter
introduced with the sea-water which flows over them.

Mr. Bowles, in his account of Spain, p. 99, who

observes, that in the vicinity of Cadiz fragments of
hrick, mortar, ἃς. thrown on the shore, are soon ce-
rnenteti together with the sand and shells into one uni-
form mass of solid stone. Α parallel effzct is noticed by
Flurl‚who tells us that fragments ofrocks are strongly
cemented together at Hir-gelling in Ravana, and that
in a short time, by the iixflux upon them of streams
impregnated with calcareous matter. Bau-aria, 23,

cess of cementation or solidification is considerably
qnickencd, and the union reuda-ed considerably more

several buildcrs in this nietropolis.—The lapidifi-

is more commonly called, is of a different descrip-

the strong, steer-glue] Glue,
among the ancients‚ as among ourselves, was prepar-
ed from the sinewy membr-anes of almost every qua-
druped; but that obtained {rom bulls and bullocks
was most esteemcd for its tenacity—-the phrase in the
original, ver. 1067, is glutine taurino. And in Pliny,
Nat. Hist. xxviii. 17, we meet with the following
account: “ Glutinum praestantissimum fit ex auri-
bus taurorum et genitalibus.'' There is an admira-
ble paper by Mr. Hatchett upon the subject of ani·
mal gluten or gelatin, to be found in the Philosophi-
cal Transactions for the year 1800, entitled “ Che-
mical Experiments on Zo'dphytes; with some Ob-
servations on the component parts of Membrane.''
“ Membranes,'' Mr. Hatchett observes, “ are for
the most part composed of gelatin in its different
states, from that of soluble mucilage to strong glue.
The gelatin from the hide of the rhinoceros is pe-
culiarly viscid z that from ecl—skin is more readily ob-
tained, and in larger proportion, but its viscidity is
not equal to the former. The cutis of the human
body is little more than gelatin—the cuticle contains
it, but more slightly. It is traced in hair, and is the
ba>is of its flexibility : for the harder and less flexible
hair yields it in a smaller proportion, while the soster,
when exposed to boiling water, loses both flexibility
and strength. The tougher the membrane, in gene-
ral the more viscid the gelatin ς and hence the
strength of the glue described by our poet in the
verse before us. The horris of animals contain also
