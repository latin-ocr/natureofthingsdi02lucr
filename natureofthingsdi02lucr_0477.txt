THE NATURE OF THINGS.

Springs the bright flame, the splendid hues evinc’d.

For from the sun such seeds the clouds must drink,

Δ Pour’d down perpetual, or their rain-bow skirts

No lustre e'er could redden.

To narrower spheres the lashing winds compress,

These when once

Forth from their pores the radiant atoms stan,

And wave the serpent-brandish through the skies.

Thus springs the flash, too, when the filmy clouds
Abrade beneath the whirlwind: for, so thin

VVears oft their web by fricti0n‚ the red seeds 2

to separate these colours alone? And why are they
nrely, if at any time, seen tinctured with bluc and
green, as well aa red, orange and yellow 3¹¹ And he
immediately propones au explanation, which appears
far more simple and correct than either of the former.
‘⁴ Ia it· not more creditne-,¹¹ says he, ‘⁸ that the sepn-
mion of rays is made in passing through the hori-
zontal atmonphere¹ and that the clouds only reflect
and transmit the sun’s light, as any half-transparent
colonrless body would do ἓ For, since the atmospherc
reflecte a greater quantity os blue and violet mys
than of the rest, the sun’a light transmittcd through
it ought to incline towards yellow, orange, or red:
especially when passing through a protracte-d volume
of aiu whence the sun's horizonta! light, or that of
morning and ewning, must necessarily bc tincturcd
with a deep orange, and even red; and thc colour
become still deeper nster sun-set, or before sun·rioe.'’
Upon which theory hc couchndcs, that thc clouds, at
different altitudcs, may exhibit every possible combi-
nation ofcolours, by merely reflecting the nun's inci-
dent light as they receive it.

As to the blue of the atmosphere, M. Bouguer. in·

 

geniously enough, attributes it to the constitution os
the air itself, by which the fainter coloured mys of
violet, indigo, and blue‚ are incapable os urging their
way through any conside-able tract nsit: and upon
the same principle he accounts for the blue §ludows
with which the nir osten abounds, and particularly on
the summits of immense aud distant mountains.
