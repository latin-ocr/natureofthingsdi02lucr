Boon IV. THE NATURE OF THINGS. 147

Our ceaseless care, or what the mind explores
With patient pause, in dreams we still pursue.
The lawyer, thus, o'er briefs, and statutos pores;
New wars the soldier wage83 with the winds
Strives the vain mariner3 while we the laws 990
Of nature scan perpetual, and how best,
When trac'd, to paint them in our native tongue.
So various lores beside, and arts diverse
Haunt, oft, in sleep the cheated mind of man.

Has mark’d the public stage, though now no more

It strike his senseS, through his porous frame

Still the light images admits that float

Countless around him. Hence, for many a day,

E’en while awake, the scene before his eyes roeo
Seems still renew'd3 the Vlight-deckt dancers move
