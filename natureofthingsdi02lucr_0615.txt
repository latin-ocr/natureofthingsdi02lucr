THE NATURE OF THINGS.

601

And though, unburied, corse o’er corse the streets

Oft throng'd promiscuous, still the plumy tribes,

The forest monsters, either far aloof

Kept‚ the foul stench repulsing, or if once

1265

Dar'd they the pluncler, instant fate pursu'd.

Nor feath'ry flocks at noon‚ nor beasts at night
Their native woods desertetl3 with the pest
Remote they languish'd‚ and full frequent died.

But chief the dog his generous strength resign'd‚

1270

Tainting the high-ways, while the ruthless bane
Through every limb his siek'ning spirit drove.

With eager strife th' enormous grave was snatch'd‚

this verse, reminds us of the following verse in the
Iliad ε

Ουρηας μεν πρωτὺν ἔπωχίτο, καί κυνᾶς αργους-

Α. 50.

On mules and dogs th’ infection first began.
Po Ρ ε.

To the same effect, Virgil :

 

Hinc canibus blandis rabies venit

Next struck the pest the gentle race of dogs.

Ver. 1 273. With mger strise th’ cnm-mous grave »ti-as

and tremendous description, ver. ‚1225 :
incomitata rapi certabant funera vasta.

Funeral cere-monica were performed wnh more
pomp and precision among the Athe-ninus than among
any other people‚ whether the corae were bui-nt, crn-
bal-ned, or buried ; for their religion allowed them un
option in all these different ways. Of these mc-
thods. however, the funeral pyrc was generally acconi-
panicd with the greatest degree of magnificencc and

pageantry. But in the present period, such splendid
solemnities could, in no respect, be c‹.mplied with ;
and to remedy the evil, as far as possible, large ex-
cavations were dug in the suburbs of the city, as so
many graves for general use, and to which every
onc had an cqnal acccss. Such. however, wag the
perpetual crowd of corses conveyeil to theu· common

poet daringly expresses it. to ΜΛΔ-Ι) at the first op-
