THE NATURE OF THINGS.

By man once swallow’d stamps his instant fate.

These facts to solve, thy mind must first retract*

A doctrine earlier urg’d, that all things hold

660

Deep in their texture seeds unlike of form3

And that each sentient class by food sustain'd‚

Sin'ce large the variance of its outer make,

And stamp generic, must from nutrient seeds

Of form unlike be rear’d‚ and powers diverse.

665

But if its seeds thus differ, different too

Must prove in shape the fine absorbent pores

VVhence draws the frame its nurture, o’er the tongue

titude of experimentu, to demonstrate its muscular vi-
gour. When tin tubes filled with grain, and in-
volved in several duplicatures of tin over them, were
forced into the gizzard of this animal, and allowed
to continue there for about tweive hours 3 on dissect-
ing it, after this period of time, they were discovered
to be broken, erusbed, or most surprisingly distorted.
Spalanzani‚ indeed, afterwards repeated the experi-
ment with fragments of sharp-pointcd glass, and balls
oflead with needles, and even lancets projecting from
the surface about a quarter of an inch in every di—
recti0n; and uniformly found, on dissecting the bird
about ten or twelve hours afterwards, that the points
of glass were rounded and polished ς and the points
of the needlee and lanects broken off abruptly‚ close
to ‘the surface of the balls in which they were in-
serted. In some cast-³, he suffered the animal to dis-
charge thcm naturally, which was done without any
apparent pai-13 and in no instance did he discover,
upon dissection, the amanen degree of laceration in
tlie interior coatiug of the gizznrd.

In the stomachs of many os the seatliered tribes
we almost unisormly meet with a variety os little

tionem these were ingeniously supposed, by the
Voi.. ll.

late Mr. J. Hunter‚ to serve the purpose of grinding
into smaller pic-ces the ruggcd food on uhich they
frequently subsist. See his observ vations on Diges-
tion. And it is a known fact, that cmws, when
supplied with bean seeds, will fasten them un nder their
feet, and break them to pieccs by repeated strokes
