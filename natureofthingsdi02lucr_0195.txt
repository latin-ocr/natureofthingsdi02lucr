Boon IV. THE NATURE OF THINGS. 181

Shun thou the toils that waitz for easier far
Those toils to shun, than, when thy *foot once slides,

To break th’ entangling meshes, and be free.

Yet though ensnar'd‚ and in the silky net 11 90
Led captive, thou may'st still, if firm of mind,
And by these numbers sway'd‚ thy foot release.—
First‚ the defects, then, of the form ador’d
Of mind, or body, let thy memory ne’er
One hour forget ; for these full oft mankind 1 195
See not, by passion blinded3 while, revers’d‚
Charms they bestow which never were the fair's.
Hence frequent view we those, each grace denied,
The coarse, the crooked, held in high esteem.
And lovers laugh o'er lovers, and exhort ι 200
Offerings to Venus since so vilely sway'd‚

While yet themselves are sway'd more vilely still.

Yea, numerous arethe valiant whom she ham slain· As α ltirdsrom slve net asthesowlcr.
