THE ‘NATURE OF THINGS.

sina in Italy. In all these places, when the weather
is perfectly calm, and, consequendy, the sea almost
without motion, the atmosphere, more especially in
a dry and hot season, imbibes a considerable portion
of the water upon which its lower stratum presses3
and hence, in the night-time, becomes condensed
and hazy. As the morning rises, however, and the
sun-beams resume their vigour, the atmosphere once
more rarefies, and re-acquires its transparency. If
it mrefy eq'uably, and homogeneously. every object
beheld through it must necessarily be exhibited in its
real proportion and figure: but it happens, occa·
sionally, that in some parts of its texture, it seems
to be more closely interwoven than in others; and
hence in its general expansion, veins, or striae, like
those often discovered in glasS, make their appear—
ance, of different densities and diameters. In this
case, every stria, like every globule of rain, in con-
sequence οἷ the variation of its density from the
common density of the atmosphere, becomes a re-
fracting or a reflecting body; in other words, a
pidem, or a min-or, or both. If, then, a single glo-
bule os rain, properly disposed, be able to produce a
phanomenon so marvellous as that of the rainbow‚
what phaenomena may we not expect, what vari-
anon, inversion, contorsion, and grotesque and mon-
strous representation of images, beheld through a
column of the atmospherc, intersected by so many
aerial prisma of different densium, and miri-ors of
different sursaceS, in which the catheti may bc in-
numer-able, and sor ever varying? We may hence,
moreover‚ readily tracc the cause of an occasional
duplication of imagcs in the atmospherc, of a par-hc-
lion, and parasclene, or double sun, and double
moon, from the reflection of these luminaries in an
opposite part of the heavcns, when they arc a little:
above the horizon 3 aa also of the very curions mirage
remarkcd by M. Monge in tho.- hot and sandy desert
between Alexandria *and Cairo, in which, from an
inverte-d image of the cer-ultan sky inter-nzixcd with
the ground secut-ry, the neighbonring villagcs :ip-
peared ιο bc surronndcd with the most beautiful

sheeting of water, and to exist, like islands. in ns
liquid expanse, tantalizing the eye by an unfaithsul
representation of what was earnestly desired.

The mirage has not been suffered to lie neglectcd
by the poets. It is to the aerial phantoms ex-
hibitcd by this memor, that Milton alludes, in the
following verses :

As when, to warn proud cities, war· appears

VVaged in the troubled sky, and armies rush

To battle in the clouds; before each van

Prick forth the airy knights, and couch their
spears,

Till thickcst legions close ; with scats of arms

From either side of heaven the welkin burns.

From the same image, Klopstock appears to have
derived the idea of the rising and variegated vaponr
that formed the celestial body of Rachel in the psc-
ture of her ascension from the grave. The whole
delineation is beautiful, and requires no apology for
being quoted ι
