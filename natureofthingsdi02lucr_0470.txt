Percutiat lapis, aut ferrum : nam turn quoque lumen

Exsilit, et claras scintillas dissupat ignis.

Sed tonitrum fit utei post auribus adcipiamus,

Fulgere quam cernant oculei, quia semper ad aureis

Id licet hinc etiam cognoscere: caedere si quem

Ancipiti videas ferro procul arboris auctum,

Ante fit ut cernas ictum, quam plaga per auras

Det sonitum: sic fulgorem quoque cernimus ante,

Quam tonitrum adcipimus, pariter qui mittitur igni

though, in reality, they have only been detached
from their ae'rial station by the violence of the tem-

, pest, and, perhaps, at the same time, have been

shivered into fragments extremely minute in compa-
rison with the magnitude of the original quarry.
The entire phaeuomenon is thus painted by Thom-

that the cloud or substratum whence it issues, con·
tains a vast multitude of attenuate fiery particle-⁸,
and that these, when conflicting with each other.

combat of clouds against clouds, produce, by their

Ver. 163. But the blue lightning springs from seed:
osfire] Having discussed the phaenomenon of

the tonitrus, or thunder-peal, our poetic philosopher
now proceeds to the consideration of the fulgur, the
flash, or corruscation by which it is generally intro-

manner as the particles of fire contained in steel or
flint become visible when struck against other frag-
ments of flint or steel : and that when the thunder-
peal accompaniee them, they first rusb upon the
external senses, because postest of a much greater
velocity of motion. His second explanation is,
that the combination of these igneous particles in
the interior of a cloud my sometimes generate sech
a degree of heat, and, consequently, so extremely
rarefy the contained and elastic air as to buret the
cloud altogether, and thus exhibit the inclosed ig-
neous meteor to the naked eye, ‘⁴ scattering long
trails of corruscating fire” through the horizon. To
