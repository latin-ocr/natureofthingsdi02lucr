THE NATURE OF THINGS.

What next ensues, the substance what that forms

The bolt, at times, the mystic meteor shoots‚

This its own stroke betrays, its caustic scathe‚

And the foul scent of sulfur steaming round ;

Marks not of wind, or shower, but fise alone:
While, oft, the volant mischief we behold

Domes, towers, and temples kindling into flame.

This igneous shaft, then, nature ream, recluse,
