DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. lv.

quue petit corpus mens, unde est saucia amore.

Namque omnes plerumque cadunt in volnus; et illam

Emicat in partem sanguis, unde icimur ictu:

Et, si conminus est, hostem ruber obcupat humor.

Sic igitur, Veneris qui telis adcipit ictus,

1045

Sive puer membris muliebribus hunc jaculatur,

Seu mulier, toto jactans e corpore amorem3

Unde feritur, eo tendit, gestitque coire,

Et jacere humorem in corpus de corpore ductum:

Namque voluptatem praesagit multa cupido.

1050

Haec Venus est nobis3 hinc ductum est nomen Amoris:

Hinc illa et primum Veneris dulcedinis in cor

Stillavit gutta, et subcessit frigida cura.

' Nam, si abest, quod ames, praesto simulacra tamen sunt

Ver. 1068. Then springs the tendor humour, the
warm wish] Whatever degree of imagined
indelicacy those of more frigid feelings may trace in
the following verses, there is, 1 think, infinitely more
in many parts of Thomson’s Seasons, although it is
not the fashion, in consequence of the spirit of un-
feigned piety and benevoleneev that perv-ades his poem,
to attribute such a character to it. Almost every
feature of the subsequent description will be found to
have been bon-owed, and introduced into his Spring,
where the picture exhibits an equal moral3 but 1 arn
now alluding more particularly to his episode of Mu-

sidora undressing and bathing in the presence os her
secreted lover:

 

the latent Damon drew

Such madd'ning draughts of beauty to the soul,
As sor a while o‘erwhelm’d his raptur'd thought
With luxury too daring.

Susous, ii. ¹330·

Throughout the whole of this story, the imagery
exhibited is in the highest degree voluptuous, and
that without the apology of moral precept, or phy·
siclogical reasoning.
