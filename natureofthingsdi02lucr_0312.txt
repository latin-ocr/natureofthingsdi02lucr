DE RERU M NATURA.

Lrn. V.

Nonne vides etiam, quam magno pondere nobis

Substineat corpus tenuissima vis anima'l' ;

Propterea, quia tam conjuncta, atquc uniter apta, est ?

Denique, jam saltu pernici tollere corpus

560

Quis potis est, nisi vis animae, quae membra gubernat?

Jamne vides quantum tenuis natura valere

Possit, ubi cst conjuncta gravi cum corporc3 ut ac'r

Conjunctus terris, er nobis est animi vis?

Nec nimio solis major rota,

nec minor ardor,

565

Esse potest, nostris quam sensibus csse videtur.

Ν am, quibus e spatiis quomque ignes lumina possunt

Adlicere, et calidum membris adflare vaporem3

Nihil ipsa intervalla in sis de corpore librant

Epicurus himself spoke with as much diffidence upon
this subject as Lucretius has done, and has met with
a merited degree of praise for his modesty from Des
Coutures: “ il a parle,’' says he, ‘⁴ plus modestement
que tous les philosophes; il a dit ce qu’ il a cru du
And he
refers us, as does Mr. Wakefield also, for a proos of

this diffidence‚ to the express testimony of Plutarch,
de Placit. philosoph. lib. ii. c. 21. meov905 παλυ

‘¹ Epicurus, moreover, asserts, that
the sun may probably be much os the same magni-
tude and nature as he appears to be, orbe may be a

little less, or a little larger.'' And in a passage im-
mediately antecedent, hcdeelares that the opuiiens of
any os the philosophers may be true for any thing he
is able to decide to the contrary. These opinions
undoubtedly were extremely various; for while He-

raclitus contended that the sun's diameter was a sin·

gle foot, Anaxagoras maintained that it was as large
as the country of Peloponnesus; Anaximander, that
it was of the precise dimensions of the earth itself3
Macrobius, following the calculation of the Egyp-

tians, that it was eight times as large ; Eratosthenes, ⁴

that it was sevensand-twenty times ; Cleomedes, three
hundred timesz Hipparchus, upwards of a thousand
times ; and possidonius, nearly sixty thousand times.
While amidst this infinite diversity of opinion, Ar-
chelaus, Plato and Cicero, modestly declared, with

Epicurus and Lucretius, that they knew nothing

‘ab—out the size of the sun whateyer.

Nor is this ignorance and oppositiun of belief
among the Greek and Roman philosophers to be
wondered at : sor, with all our boasted improvement ‚
in mathematical science and mathematical instru-
ments, we have even now chuired no precise know·
ledge of the comparative dimensions of the sun, and
at the same time, are totally ignorant of his substance.
