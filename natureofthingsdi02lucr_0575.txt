Boox VI. THE NATURE OF TIIINGS.

List‚ then, for now thy closest ear we claim.

And, first, from all things bodies most minute
F low forth for ever, scatter'd, and diffus'd,
VVounding the pupil‚ and compelling sight.
From forms defin’d spring odours; from the sun
Thus heat exhales3 cold, dewy damp from streams,

And the rough spray from ocean, with fierce fang

Gnawing the mound that dares resist its waves.
Thus sounds, too, flutter through the breezy air;
And when the beach we traverso, oft the tongue
Smarts with the briny vapour; or, at hand,

If the bruis'd wormwood yield its acrid juice,
We taste th’ essential bitter and abhor.

Thus some light effluence streams from all create,
Strearns forth for ever, void of dull repose,

Tow’rds every point diffus'd; for man perceives
Where’er his station3 sight alike exists,

The sense of fluent odours, and of sounds.
This thus premis’d, recal we next to mind
How rare the frame of all things, as erewhile

Conspicuous prov’d we in our earliest strain.
