Dionysus, Osyris, or the Sun, all which, according
to Diodorus Siculus, vol. i. p. 17. were parallel and
convertible terms: for Dionysus, or Thyonysus‚ de-
rived from Thu-On-As-Es‚ implies “ the illustrious
region of sacrifices offered to the Sun ;” and of course
means literally “ the temple os the Sun :” and Osy-
ris, derived in like manner from As-Ur-Es, strictly
“ the region of the radiant or illustrioris Sun‚” refers
to the same structure, or may literally be rendered
the Sun himself. The mythological mother of Bac*
chus was Semele (Shem or) Sem-EL-A, “ the region
of the god Shem ;'’ for Shem, it should seem, was
also deified in these idolatrous times, as well as his
brother Ham.

It is stated by some critics, and particularly by
Praetextatus upon Macrobius, Saturnal. i. 18. that as
Bacchus was often represented as the Sun, so Ceres,
the divinity to whom he was attached, was equally
expressive of- the Moon ; and a new allegory or sable
is hereby produced, elegantly and pertinently ty-
pical of the changing seasons, and the fertilizing
power of the solar orb, without the conjoint influ-
cncc of which the earth would be a barren wilder-
ucss. And it is not improbable that Ceres was thus
occasionally represented, from the confusion of apply-
ing one common name to several divinitics. The
more general name for the Moon was Diana, proba-
bly derived from the Chaldee Thoth, similar to the
Egyptian Thuth‚ or, as Herodotus writes it, Xnth τ
from Thoth, Thos, Θεος, Am, Amr, Anam, Diana.
But Thoth or Thuth refers, as Ι have already ob-
aen-ved in Note on Book 11. 1¹67. to Noah‚ the
great builder of the ark; and Thyana, or Diana,
ought, therefore, in like manner, to refer, and actually
did¹ do so originally, to Aphrodite or Venus, the
syxubulical female power under which this vessel was
typified while on the dduge, who, in consequence
hereos. was denominated by the Egyptians ΠὰΟὰΡ
and naeoep (221101·),w11ence naeoep eliam,
⁴⁸ the city of Venus, or Athor‚’' and whence also

Thyatyra, Thu-Athor-A in Lybia. But from the
crescent form of the ark, the crescent was an image
always reverenced by arkite idolators of every de-
scription, and became eventually typical of the arkite
goddess herself: hence, both the moon and the coir,
in consequence of the form of their horas, became
emblems of Isis, and Athor or Venus, which arc
convertible terms, and this deity was eventnally wor-
shipped under each of these figures. But Isis or
Venus, as I have already observed, was the goddess
Demeter3 Demeter was therefore the Moon: and
hence, when at length the term Demeter was be-
stowed upon Ceres, she also came into possession of
that of the Moon, Thyana, or Diana. And it is to
this new character of Bacchus and Ceres, as symbo-
lical of the Sun and Moon, that virgil evidently al.
ludes:

 

Vos, o clarissima mundi
Lumina, labentem caelo quae ducitis annum,
Liber, ct alma Ceres.

Gsoamcs, i. 5.

Ye lights of heaven ! whose sovereign sway
Leads on the year around th' ethereal way,
Bacchus and Ceres !

 

Plutarch, indeed, expressly tells υς, that Osyris,
Bacchus, Serapis, Sol, and several others, signisy the
same deity. And Apuleius, that Isis, venus, Diana,
Ceres, Minerva, and many more, constitute but one
goddess under a variety of names.

attachment of Bacchus to nymphs of this luxuiiant
form, is thus glanced at by Anacreon :
