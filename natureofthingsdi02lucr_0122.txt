DE RERUM NATU RA.

Iim. 1v.

Propter subtilem naturam, et tenuia texta.

Caetera de genere hoc eadem ratione creantur:

Quae quom mobiliter summa levitate feruntur,

Ut prius obstendi‚ facile uno conmovet ictu

Quae libet una animum nobis subtilis imago:

Tenuis enim mens est, et mire mobilis, ipsa.

Haec fieri, ut memoro, facile hinc cognoscere possis;

Ver. 766. Thus all with ease developes. ] That

(he doctrine herc elucidated was that of Epicurus, we

 

might farther corroborate, if it were necessary, by a
passage in Cicero, which Lambinus indeed has cited
for this very purpose. It is thus he writes to his
friend Cassius, who was a strenuous disciple of the
Epicurean school, Epist. Famil. lib. xv. 16. Fit
nescio quid, ut coram, adesse videaris, cum scribo

aliquid ad tc, neque id κατ’ {ismara Φαντασιας ut di-

cunt amici hii novi, qui putant etiam τας &avon-mm
φκηαιτιαις, spectris Catianis excitari: “ I know not
how it is, but wlienever I write to you, you seem
always present before me ς yet not as the mere san-
tasy of those images your new friends are accustomed
to maintain ς who dcem that even the fantasies of the
mind are excited by the spectres so zcalously con-
ten-ded for by Catius.”
both from the present epistle, and more fully still
from one of Cassius in reply (ep. 19), was an Epicu.

This Catius, as we learn

rcan philosopher, and public professor of the Epicu-
rean school, but in no very high degree of credit
with either Cassius or Cicero.

And now, admitting the fragility of this theory,
to what system shall we betake ourselves in its stead ἒ
Itis truly astonishing, to behold the variety of hypo-
theses that, from time to tirne, have been brought
forwards, and how perpetually they have yielded to
others of a newer birth ; and which, perhaps, have
had no superior recommendation than what results
from novelty alone.

And first, as to the ‘Platonic system of Ide-as.
Every material thing that exists, or can exist, has,

to the opinion of Plato, may exist, and did originally
exist without form, and form without matter. These
eternal and immaterial forms of things he denomi-
nated Ideas. And the actim of all material bodies
upon the exter-nal senses, he asserted was immediately
followed by the sels-presentation of these immaterial
archetypes to the immaterial mind. Of the externa!
and material world, the mind therefore, strictly speak-
ing, can‚ upon this hypothesis, know nothing; it
has no perception of it whatsoever, and the only ob-
jects of its real knowledge are those eternal and im-
material ideas, after the patterns οι· forins of which
the material world was created.

Plato, among the multitude of his disciyles, had
two of pre-eminent merit, Xenocrates and Aristode.
To Xenocrates this sublime doctrine was sufficiently
conspicuous; and he not only taught it with no
small degree of reputation in the Academic hall in
which he had received his education, but added to
its mysticisni by the importation of various new dog-
mas from the fountain of Pythagoras. The acute
and subde spirit of Aristotle, however, was not so
easily to be satisficd: he started a variety of un-
answemble objections ; and finally deserted the Aca-
demy, and established a school of his own. In this
new institution it was contended, that whatever was
possest of form must necessarily be material: the
conception of immaterial forms of material sub-
stances was declared to be nonsense ; and the
Platonic doctrine of ideas was totally exploded. But
what was to be substituted in its stead? In what
manner was the mind now to be operated upon so as

upon this theory, an eternal and immaterial form of to gain a knowledge of the existence ἦ external ob-

irself existing at the same time ε for matter, according

jects? The world of Platonic ideas'aeems still perti-
