THE NATURE OF THINGS.

Boon IV. 81

Nor of like figure wind they through the ear
When roars the deep-ton’d trumpet·‚ or the horu
With hoarse, harsh gamut strains its serpent throat3 565
And when the swan, arnid the pangs of death,
Pours o’er PARNAssus his last, liquid dirge.

The vocal tide thus rear’d, when from the lungs
Sublime we press it through the bronchial duct,
The tongue daedalian, and vivacious lips 570
Mould it to words, articulated nice.

And when not far th' irruptive voice is thrown
It strikes emphatic, and is heard distinct,

Unchang'd‚ uninjur’d every primal seed.

 

como quando el cisne sicnte

El ansia postn'mem que le aquexa,

Y tienta el cuci-po misero y deflente,
Con triste y lamentable sun se quem,

Y se despide con funesto canto

Del espiritu vital que del se alcja.

Mid the last anguish he sustains,

The swan, through all his dying paius,
Thus tunes his melancholy lay,

And sighs and sings his soul away.

The Hebrew bards, to express the same idea, em-
ploy a different image, but one of at least equal ele-

sczztcd as the gard-n or vitup-ard in which words are

planted: and hence speech, or the increase and mul-
