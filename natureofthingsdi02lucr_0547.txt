Boon VI. THE 'NATURE OF THINGS. 533

Haunts of the ETfflop—tribes3 yet far beyond 750
First bubbling‚ distant, o'er the burning line.
Then ocean, lmply, by th' unclevious breeze.
Blown up its channel, heaves with every wavc
Heaps of high sands, and dams its wonted course:
VVhence narrower, too, its exit to the main, 7 5 5
And with less force the tardy stream descends.
Or, tow'rds its fountain‚ ampler mins, perchance,
Fall, as th’ ETESIAN fans, now wide unfurl'd,
Ply the big clouds perpetual from the north
Far o'er the red equat0r3 where condens'd, 760
Pond’rous, and low, against the hills they strike‚
And shed their treasures o’er the rising flood.
Or, from th’ ETfflop-mountains, the briglit sun
Now full matur'd, with deep-dissolving ray
May melt th’ agglomerate snows, and down the plains 76 5
Drive them, augmenting, hence, th' incipient stream.
But come th' AvERm beck0n; and the muse
Their nature, next, their depths‚ their lakes shall pierccu

And first their name from power adverse to birds

noticcd by poets of modern day. Thus, Milton, The smn inp ἰιΙιι ιιι ιι1ιει 1ιιι ιςι ιιιι11ιιι ι
