Whence scarce stupendous seems it that the moon

should punctual fise, and, rising, punctual die,

Since things at large, so punctual, things succeed.

Thus, too, to various causes may’st thou charge

The sun’s eclipse, or shade of lunar light.

For why should rather, ’twixt the sun and earth,

The moon rush rampant, and with shadowy orb,

shut from mankind the radiant fount of day

Than aught besides that haply may subsist

ιπισκοτουσης· esbum 31, του της γης σκιασματος. In this
dubiety os mindLLucret-iusgen-urgentes two different
theon-ies by which eclipses 9fijthgqsun‘anLi-moon were
resolved in his own era. The first, which was the
more common, and is admittedssissn-thc present day,
supposed the interposition of t-lie mponlffi—so-mrefflot-hcr
body· equally oquffisst-qge-n—tfflfflfiffl tvheer carth
in the phaenomenon of a solar eclipse; and of the
earth, or some other opake substance between the

 

uun and moon in that of a lunar eclipse. Mo-
dern astronomy admits of no other interposition,> how-
ever, in both these instance-s, than the moon and
earth respectively‚ at least in our ordinary eclipses.
Though the occasional transit of both Mercnry and
Venus over the sun's disc, that produces a partial
eclipse of the latter, will in some measure justisy our
poet in the conception of some: other opake bodies,
besides those os the moon and carth, by which such a
phaenomcnon may-'be engendered.

The second conjecture he enumerates was first in-
troduced by Xenophanem and is in perfect conso-
nance with his theory of the prpduqtiqrr otJa HQWJU

buscelestial luminaries once in every twenty-four hours,

from the periodieal assemblnge and conglobation of
the particles offrre for this purpose, as specified in
the Note on ver. 665 os this Book; and their regn-
lar obstruction and delay at particular seasons of the
year from an increascd density of the atmosphere in
definite places. Pressing this system a little further,
Xenophanes accounted for the eclipse of the snn and
moon, by asset-ting that, occasionally, the obstruction
these luminarit‘s met with in their voyage round the
carth was so violent and irresistible ns to snppress
their light altogether through a consider-able portion
of their journey: and that they only again became
cnlightcned when they had at length csenped swm
this ‹lolefnl encounter, and had passed through sut-h

innuit-al regions.
