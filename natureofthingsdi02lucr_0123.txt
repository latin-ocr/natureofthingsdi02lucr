Thus spring, too, kindred phantoms, by their make

All volatile, and, with percussion joint,

Rousing the mind, soon rous'd‚ since rear'd itself

Of subtlest texture, and vivacious most.

Thus all with ease developes.

 

naciously to have hovered around Aristotle, in the
conception and evolution of his new system: and hence,
although he banishes the name, without any great
variation he retains the thing, and determines
upon the introduction of phantasms or species iu
their stead. That is to say, he gives the naked and
ideal forms of Plato a corporeal clothing, and here-
by makes them persectly harmonize with the theory
which Epicurus was at that very moment teaching
at Mitylene, and which he had bottomed upon the
theory of Democritus. But Aristode, who admitted
of spiritual intelligences as well as material objects,
made an addition to this hypothesis of the atomic
founder, and contendtd, that the intellectual world
had its phantasms or effigies, as well as the external
or sensible3 and that while things sensible are per-
ceived by scnsible species, things intellectual are
perceived alone byi.itellectual specics. So th.1t wc
have still the doctrine ofemanations, but in a more
complex form. The hull: os mankind seems fond of
mystery. and this complex doctrine of Aristotle not
only gradually gained nu ant-endancyin the world, but,
from about the fifth century ofthe Christian aera to the
age of Det Carxes,ssourished in most of these-bools of
Europe, almost without a competitor. The com-
prthensive mind of Des cartes, however, was not to
be imposed upon by unmeaning obssurnics aad phi-
losophie-al contens. H.- wes determined to submit
every thing to the test ol* the most rigid investiga·
tion. and to disbelieve every thing ti!l l:e was irre-
tintibly compellcd to assent. And the consequence

sible, though pret ending to a different explanation.

The system of Des Cartes is, with a few shades of
variation, the system of Locke ς and as the latter has
carried it to its utmost degree of perfectiori, letus,
in as few words as possible, comment upon each at
the same time. Both philosophers set out with τι
determination to prove every thing, and to demon-
strate the means by which every thing is pereeived.
The former attacks his own existence, and the latter
that of the world around him; and each witha view os
evidencing the reality os the objects of their attack :
but the former cannot prove his own existence, and
is obliged at last to take it for granted 3 and the lat-
ter, instead of ascertaining the existence of an exter-
nal world, demonstrates‚ from the principles upon
which he reasons», that a: least half of what was gene.
rally conctived tn constitute the world, the secontlary
qualities of bodies, have no real existence whatsocver,
and :ire nothing more than mere ideas of the mind it-
sels.

Upon neither of these theories do we pcrccive ilie
objects that surround us, when any impression is made
by them upon the external organs of sense, but ilie
mere ideas of those objecta :ilone; and these idem,
