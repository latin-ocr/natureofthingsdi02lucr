THE NATURE OF THINGS.

·11

Term'd by the learned IMAGES or nimos:

Forms that, like pellicles‚ when once thrown off

Clear from the surface of whate'er exists‚

35

Float unrestrain’d through ether.⁴ Fearful these

Oft through the clay, when obvious to the sense,

But chief at midnight, when in dreams we view

Dirc shapes and apparitionS‚ from the light γ

Shut out for ever, and each languid limb

40

With horror gaunt convulsing in its sleep.

He maintains‚ that these floscules or pellicles of ob-
jects are perpetually emanating from all substance-³1
whatever ; and that, as the permancnce of smell pro-
cceds only from the perpetual arrival offresh par-
ticlcs os perfume within the region of the nostrils,
so the permancnce of sight is produced in the same
manner, from the unfuiling arrival of fresh imag-cs
or pellicles of objects within the region of vision.
and their perpetually striking upon, and exciting
the optic nerve-

This ingenious, though incorrect theory of optics
did not originate with Epicurus, but was received
from the school of Democritus, although the former
is reported to have added some considerable improve-
mcnts to it, and to have raised it to its utmost point
os reputation. Epicurus, as well as Democritus,
denominated these filins or flosculus of bodies uthans,
τυπους, and ὑμενας, “ mols, imag-⁶⁵, and mades? in.
differently. To which ternis, Lucretius, for the sake
of variety, has added the names of effigies, specics,
sormae, exuviae, spolia, and cortices, or peclings.

It must be constat, that the ancient philosophers
err-:d more with respect to the theory of optics, than
with respect to any other subject of physical scit-nce
that fell bem-ath their investigation ι with catoptrics,
they had but little comparative acquaintancc; and di-
optrics were totally unknown to them, ns we may na-
turally conclude stom the silence of Eut-lid upon this
important branch. Nummous, therefore, as are the

phaenomcna which refuse all explanation upon thc
Newtonian system, and still doubtful as are some
few of its principle& it has an unquestionable supe-
riority over the system of Epicurus: at the samc
time, there is an ingenuity, and an unity and simpli-
city of design in the latter, that considerably entitle
it to our reverence, though they cannot command

our assent. See fax-ther on this subject, the Note on
v. 221 of this Book.

Ost through the day, ] To the same ef-

sect, the creative muse cf Thornson :

 

Sliook sudden srom the bosom of the sky
A thousand shapes, or glide along the dusk,
Οι· stall< majestic on. Deep-rons’d I feel
A sacred terror, a severe dclight
Creop through my morial frame-

Ver. 39. Dia-„— slrapts aml appar-iliam, from the light
Shut out sor ever, ] A description per-

 

sectly consentaneous occurs in B. i. 137 ; :ind as thc
render will sind, in the note subjoincd to that verse,
that Vin-gil has copied it srotn the original without
the slightest alteration, he has only to turn to the
Georgics, iv. 472. and he will sind a similar copy of
the vtrse now before us. In ench of thern it occurs

thus :
—simulacrnqne luce carentum.
