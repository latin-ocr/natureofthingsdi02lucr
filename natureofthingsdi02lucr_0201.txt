THE NATURE OF THINGS.

But countless such conceits‚ and to narrate

Idle: yet grant the frame ador’d possest

Of face divine, that all the power of love

Plays o'er each limb symphoneOUS, others still

Exist of equal beauty, still ourselves

Once liv'd without her, and full well we know

She, too, each art essays the bases need;

And so with scents bedaubs her that her maids

Far fly opprest, and vent their smother'd laugh.

Then, t00‚ the wretched lover oft abroad

Bars she, who at her gate loud weeping stands,

Caldior est ; acres inter numeretur. Opinor‚
Haec res et jungit, junctos et servat amicos.

Su. l. iii. 38.

And yet a shorter method we may sind,

As lovers to their fair one fondly blind,

E’en on her foulness can dclighted gaze :

For Hagne's wen can good Balbinus please.
O! were our weakness to our friends the same,

’ And stamp'd by virtue with some honour’d name.

Nor should wc to their faultsbe more severe
Than an indulgent father to his heir.
If with distortcd eyes the urchin glares,
‘⁴ 0! the dear boy—how prettily he stares !''
Is he of dwarfish, and abortive size ?
“ Sweet little moppet !¹‘
Or is th' unshapen cub deform’d and lame?
He kindly lisps him o’er some tendet· name.

the fond father eries.

Thus, if your sriend’s too srngally severe,
Let him a wisc tconomist appear.
[s he, perhaps, impertinent and vain ι’
“ The.- pleasant creature means to entertain.'’
Is h:- too free to prate. or frankly rude?
“ 'l‘is manly phimum all, and fortitude.”
Is he too warm? ‘⁸ No : spirited and bold.''

Thus shall we gain new friends, :ind keep theold.

Et miseram tetris se subfit odoribus ipsa :

In ulrich we certainly find no mention made of
white lead or vermillion: Marchetti‚ neverthelcss,

The advice of Graux-ille upon the same custom, which
has not altogether l<ft us in modern days, may be herc
pertinently adduced ε

Cloris this costly way tu stink give o'er;

Tis throwing sweets into a common sltorc ;
Not au Arabia would sufficient be:
Thou smell'st not ofthy sweets—thcy stink ofthcc.

Not in the same manner, however, the licentious,
