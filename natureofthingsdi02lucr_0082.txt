DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. IV.

Nam nihil aegrius est, quam res secernere apertas

Ab dubiis, animus quas ab se protinus abdit.

Denique, nihil sciri si quis putat, id quoque nescit,

An sciri possit3 quoniam nihil scire fatetur.

Hunc igitur contra mittam contendere caussam,

Qui capite ipse suo in statuit vestigia sese.

Ver. 486. For nought more arduom than to sever
sorms

True, srom ideal by the mind ἄρχοι] ln the

translation of these verses 1 have followed the Ley-

den manuscript of Is. Vossius, in which the distich
is thus written ε

Nam nihil egrius est quam res secernere apertas
Ab dubiis, animus quas ab se protinus addit .-

“ which the mind adds immediately from itself, or
its own powers.”

But the readings are extremely various, and con-
fused in different editions and codices. For egrius
we generally meet with egregia: ; and very often for
addit, obdit: which latter variation the reader will
perceive has been preferred by Mr- Wakefield, and
of course occurs in the Latin text before us, the
integrity of which 1 have not chosen to depart from.
By Lambinus, and many other critics, the entire
distich, however, is regarded as spurious and super.
numerary: Marchetti and Creech have equally re-
jected it 3 and Gucrnier and Des Cuuturcs, who re-
tain it, have given so ambiguous an interpretation, as
to render the paraphrase more difficult thau the text.

Ver. 487. Who holds thot noutght is known, denies
l·e knows

E’m this, thus orvnIng tha! he nothing known]

There is a logical precision and beauty in the whole
of this argument that has seldom been equalled by
any dialectic writer in prose: and it is astonishing
how very nearly Mr. Locke has adopted the same
words in his discussion of the sanie subject. “ I
think nobody can in earnest‚'' says he, “ be ao scep-
tical as to be uncertain of the existence of those

things which he sees and feels. At least, he that can
doubt so far will never have any controversy with me,
since he con never be sunt. I my any thing contrary to
his opinion.·—-But yet, if, after all this, any one will
be so sceptieal as to distrust his sennes, and to affirm
that all we see and hear, feel and tane, think and
do, during our whole being, is but the series and
deluding appearances of a long dream, whereof there
is no reality; and, therefore, will question the ex·
istence of all things, or our knowledge of any thing ς
Ι must desire him to consider, that {f all be a dream,
then he does but dream who malet the question ; and so
it is not much matter that a waking man should an-
swer him. But yet, if he phasee, he may dream
that 1 make him this answer: that the certainty of
things existing iu itt-:ium ism-urm, when we have the
testimony qsour senses sor it, is not only as great as
our frame can attain to, but as our condition needs.”
Hum. Undcrs. iv. xi. 3. 8.

The poet is here, as Lactantius informs us, more
immediately directing his attaek against that sect
of the academie philosophists which was established
by Arcesilas-,5 who denied the evidence of their
senscs‚ and contended, that nothing was positively
known, and that nothing could positively be known.
The argument of Lucretius overthrows the whole
of this sophistry at the first attack; for, if no.
thing can be known, “ how,” says he, ‘⁶ do you
know this tenet ?'’ Cicero has also attaeked this
school of absurd and delirious professore, and with a
chain of argument drawn from this very passage of
Lucretius. Metrod. Nego scire nos, aciamus ne ali-
quid an nihil sciamus, &c-
