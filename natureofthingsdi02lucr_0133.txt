Βοοκ 1V. THE NATURE OF THINGS. 119

If heaven the heart, if earth, or main, possess,

Pomps, spectacles, or senates, feasts‚ or fights, 800
Does NATURE then her images create

Prompt to the moment ? whence that mortals plac’d

In the same country, in the sels-same spot,

On different themes employ the thoughtful mind ?

XVhence, too, those graceful attitudes‚ in turn, 80 5
The changeful phantorns oft in dreams disclose ?
The flexile arm that, through the measur’d dance,
To arm voluptuous answers ? and the foot
To foot symphoneom, exquisitely true ?
Taste, then, the phantoms science? are they taught 810
Thus loose to wauton mid the night's dead hours?
Or flows it not much rather that each space
Of time minutest, e'en while the fleet lip
Sounds but a syllable, of parts consists
Minuter still, within whose rapid reign 815

Rush they in swarms, towards every point propell'd?
