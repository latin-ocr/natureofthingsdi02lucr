DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. VI.

Quisque suum pro re consortem moestus humabat.

Multaque vi subita-“1 paupertas horrida suasit:

Namque suos consanguineos aliena rogorum

Insuper exstructa ingenti clamore locabant,

Subdebantque faces3 multo cum sanguine saepe

Rixantes potius, quam corpora desererentur.

In the common editions it occurs thus:

With this most nefa.ious sacrilege the dreadful pic-
tnrc closes: and the climax is well preserved, for no-
thing could possibly exet-cd the horror which the
perpetration of such an action must have excited in
:he minds both of the victors and the vanquished,
the former of whom. we may readily conceive, could

this sacred and supreme duty, when devolved upon
him by the decease of his relations or friends. Their
funerals, as I have already obser-ved in the Note on

As the mortality increased, however, we learn from
Thucydides, as well as the present history, that pub-
lic graves were dug in the vicinity of the city, and
the ceremonial was attended upon, and hurried over
