Saepe ex annellis reddit pendentibus ex se:

Quinque et enim licet interdum, pluresque, videre,

Ordine demisso, levibus jactarier auris,

Unus ubi ex uno dependet, subter adhaerens3

Ex alioque alius lapidis vim, vinclaque, noscit:

Usque adeo permananter vis pervalet ejus.

plained‚ and perhaps is altogether inexplicable. Yet
I cannot avoid observing‚ that the magnetic is not the
only state in which iron seems to have a power of
forcible attraction. M. De la Faille, an academician
of Rouen‚ observes that the sea near Chatelaillon af-
ter a storm throws up a mud on which, in the course
of a few days, appears a species os shell-fish, called
griffitcs; and that, soon aster, the whole hardens
into a stone as solid as the hardest lime-stone. In
many cases, calces of iron, minute-ly divided, form
the whole of the cemcnt here employed, or at least
powersully contribuit to the cementing quality of
other earths. “ Zinunerman,” observes Mr. Kir-
wan, ‘⁴ mixed one part filings of iron, and three
parts sand, sprinkled, οι· rather covered them with
water, and let them stand six months, at the end of
which period he found the vessel burst by the expan-
sion of the oxy-genatrd iron, and the sand so sirmly
compared, that the mass thus formed could not be
broken, but by a chisel and hammer. Henckel

Origine des Pierres, 40 ς in note ε and that this
induration may, and does take place at great depths
in thc sea, is evidently proved by the observations of
Kinman. Mem. Stockh. 1770, related by Gadd,
that an iron anchor, long deposited in the sea, had,
hardened into stone all the sand, clay, and shells
which surrounded it, to a pretty considerable dis-
tance 3 and is farther confirmed by a similar observa-
tion of Mr. Edward King, Phil. Tmns. 1779,p.35‚
that a violent storm having laid bare part of the wreck
ofa man of war that had been stranded thirty-three
years before, several masses‚ consisting of iron, ropen,
and balls, were found covered over with a hard sub-
stance, which upon examination appeared to bc sand
concreted and hardened into a kind of stone: that
which concreted round the rope retained the impres-
sion of that part of the ring to which the rope was
fmzcned, in the same manner as the impressions ofex-
trancous fossils are often found in various atrata-
Also round the iron handle of a bra-ss carmon that re—
