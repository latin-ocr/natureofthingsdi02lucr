compounded existence of matter is accredited, not
because it can be proved by argument, but because
the constitution of our nature is such, that we must
accredit it, and cannot, in our own minda, separate
v the belief of external objecta srom our sensations.
‘¹ We are compelled,’' says Dr. Reid, ‘¹ by those
original and natural jndgments, which are signified
by the term common sense, and which are a part of
that furniture which nature has given to the hu-
man understanding. These arc the inspirations
of the Almighty no less than our notioris, or
simple apprehensions: they are a part of our con-
stitution, and the discos-eries of our reason are ground-
ed upon them.” Inquiry into the Human Mind‚

But it would be in vain to pursue this very unsatisfac—
tory theory through all its objections. In avoiding
the evils which certainly attend upon that of ΜΓ.
Locke, it has introduced difficulties quite as gigan-
tic‚ and may lead to conclusions still more wild and
sceptical thau any which have been deduced from
the former.

One of the best substantiated theories of mental

perception which has evei· been communicated to the
world, is the associate system of Dr. Hartley: and it i·
a system which, Ι believe, was lately gaining ground
in this country upon the destruction of all the rest.
Like that of Dr. Reid, its grand object is to desti-oy
the doctrine of ideas, never retaining the term but
in a figurative sense: but unlike Dr. Reid's, it courts
philosophical inquiry‚ and pretends to an explanation
of almost all the phaenomena of this comprehensive
subject. *According to this elegant theory, the
nervous fibrillae of the organs os sense are solid and
clastic capillaments, and not, as has been conjectured
by many anatomists, tubuli, filled with a peculiar
fluid. On the impression of external objeets upon
these fibrillae. the whole length of the affected neri-e
becomes agitatcd with a vibratory motion, which i‘.
