Boon V. THE NATURE OF THINGS. 243

Dragg’d they their lives in darkness, then, and woe
Till sprang th’ illumin’d world ? or, if ne'er born,
What cause could man have marshall’d for complaint Ρ
Born, it behoves him, doubtless, to remain 185
In life while life one blessing can afford;
But what of vital joy ne’er tasted‚ ne’er
Rank'd with the living, how can such object,
And with what reason, that it ne'er was form'd ?
W hence could the gods the model, too, deduce 190
Of things create, the portraiture of man ?
Or in their minds how first the notion spring?
VVhence, too, the powers of atoms could they learn,
Changing their act as in position chang’d‚
If nature ne'er the visual world had rear'd Ρ 195
Atoms innum'rous, that, in countless modes,
From time eterna] have been so convuls'd
By repercussionS, by intrinsic weight
So urg'd and alter'd, and, in every form
Combin'd‚ evincing still some action new, 200
