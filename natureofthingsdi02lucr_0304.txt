theory of Epicurus, there arc still so many points of
resemblance az to indicate its origin. In either system,
the ‹lenit-ntzuy particlcs are possessed of different
zhapts and pam-:rs of mobility. Uss-dQ,Epl⁷CurpS‚

same cconomy pr·cvaiIS‚ but converse1y3 while each
supposes the earth irself to result from an agglome-
ration of the morejagged and angular‚ and conse-
quently the less volatile particles. The principal
difference consists in the number of vortices intro-
duced into the entire system: Epicurus allowing but
one, which envclopes the whole os the visible heavens‚
and embraces the star-s as well as the sun 3 and Des
Cartes contending for a ‹liversity3 transferring the
stars beyond the vortex of the solar system, and be-
atowing ou each star a distinct vortex, as well as dis-

tinct planets of its own.

Ver. 529. ——isheaven’s vast orb we dcem revolve
Romul the fixe earth, ] Among the Greek
philosophus there were two grand hypotheses, by
which it was conceived, that the various phaenomena
of the mundane sphere might be resolved : the one,
introduced first of all by Pythagoras, that the sun
constitutes the centrc osa distinct system, and is an

 

immoveable body, around which the earth and pla-
nets revolve in different periods os time, while the
stara lie beyond its boundary3 and the other of
Egyptian, or, more probably, Hindu origin, that
the carth itself forms the centre of the whole
visible sphere, and is ns immoveable as the sun upon
the theory of Pythagoras; the hzavcns revolving
round it in a perpetual vortex or gyre, from eas( to
west, and carrying with them the sun, planetS, and
stass, once in every twenty-four hom-s. The Py-

 

thagorean hypothesis was embraced by Socrates and
Plato: but from its total incongruity with the ap-
parent facts of nature, and the imperfectiori of the‘
hypothesis itsclf, as at first advanced, it received but
little encouragement‚ in any period, from the philo-
sophers of Greece or Rome, and was absolutely sup-
prest by ecclesiastica} authority in the earlier and
middle ages of the Christian aera ; and continued to
be so supprest till about two centuries ago. It was,
however, occasionally revived, even from its earliest
institution, by philosophers of distant dates fro·
each other, and by some of them considerably im-
proved and illustrated. Of these, the principal are
Nicetus of Syracuse, who contended sor the diurnal

motion of the earth round its own axis; Philolaiis, -

who discovered its annual p'ath through the ecliptic ς
Archimedes, who concentrated and exemplified the

general principles of this theory in his book De Gra· ’

norum Arenae Numero; and Aristarchus os Samos,
who elucidated still more fully the important discovery
of Philolaiis. But the triumph of the Egyptian hy-
pothesis over the Pythagorean, was principally owing
to the concurrent support it derived from Aristotle
and Epicurus, who embraced it in all its bearings, and
often plausibly applied it to the solution of the phasec
of the heavens. In its progress‚ it was still farther im-
proved by Eudoxus, Calippus, and Apollonius, till
its utmost finish was at length added to it by Ptolemy,
in the second century os the Christian aera, from
whom it derived the appell-ertion of the Ptolemaic sys-
tem. To the principles both of this system and the
Pythagoream together with the eventual triumph of
the latter over the former by the industry and la·
borious research of Copernicus in the sixteenth cen-
tury, 1 have already adverted in the Note on ῙὲιοοΙιιΠ.Δ
