ΒοοΚ V. THE NATURE OF THINGS. 353

Still from rhe soil herbs, fruits‚ and trees diverse

Shoot in profusion3 but each separate class

Ne’er blends prepost’rOUS. Things throughout proceed

In firm, undevious order, and maintain, 940

To nature true, their fixt generic stamp.

Yet man’s first som, as o'er the fields they trod,

Rear’d from the hardy earth, were hardier far3

Strong built with ampler boneS, with muscles nerv'd

Broad and substantia13 to the power of hear, 9 4 5

Of cold‚ of varying viands, and disease,

Each hour superior3 the wild lives of beasts

Leading, while many a lustre o'er them roll’d.

Nor crooked plough-share knew they, nor to drive,

Deep through the soil, the rich-returning spade3 950

Nor how the tendes seedling to replant‚

Nor from the fruit-tree prune the wither’d braneh.

things was perfectly reversed, the surface of the earth
fluas covered with dead and putrifying land-animals,
and fishes, which copiously absorbed the oxygenous
part ofthe atmosphere, and supplied only mephitic
and fixcd air. Thus the atmosphere was probably
brought to its actual state, containing little more
than one fourth of pure air, and three-fourths of
mephitic. Hence the constitution qs men must have been
weakenak and the lives os their mseebled ptherity gra-
dually reduced to their present :tandard.'’

Ver. 9μ). Nor crooker! plough-rhun knew they, nor
to ‹lrivc.] Not dissimilar is the following

description of the first racc of man in Ovid ε
Vol.. 11.

Ipsa quoquc immunis, rastroque intacta, nec ullis
Saucia vomeribus, per sc dabat omnia tellus.
Contemique'cibis, nullo cogente creatis.
Arbuteos fctus, montanaque fraga legebant
Cornaque, ct in duris haerentia mora rubetis,
Et quae deciderant patuli: Jovis arbore glandes.

Free in herself; by furrows undisturb'd.
Unhurt by ploughs, carth cve-ry want supplied.
Contcnt wnh Naturc's gists, aponuincou» pour'd‚
The hip, the haw, the berry blo-hung deep
O'cr thorn, oi· mountain, pluck'd they, apples
wild,

And acorna §cnm-ry from the trec of Jove.
