DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. IV.

Tum, quibus aetatis freta primitus insinuantur,

Semen ubi ipsa dies membris matura creavit,

Conveniunt simulacra foris e corpore quoque,

Nuntia praeclari voltus, pulchrique coloris,

Qui ciet inritans loca turguida semine multo;

Ut, quasi transactis saepe omnibus rebus, profundant

Fluminis ingenteis fluctus, vestemque cruentent.

tomenta.

Like our workmen of modern times, the fullers
among the Romans produced from their stuffs the
greatest degree of whiteness, by exposing them to the
vapour cf sulphur: and Pliny makes express mention
(lib. xxxv. 15.)of two sorts of sulphur which were re-
soi-ted to sor this purpose. Apuleius relates a story
upon this subject, which is not destitute of pleasan-
try. Metam. lib. ix. ‘⁶ A fuller’s wifc‚'' says he,
“ surprised by the unexpected retu-n of herhusband,
at the moment of her assignation with a young man,
for whom she had a little too much complaisance,
concealcd him suddenly under an osicr basket, over
which a piece of woollen stnff was spread to receive
the vapour of sulphur. The fuller presently placed
himself, together with afriend whom he had brought
home with him, at the supper table. During sup-
per, the concealed lover, who was almost suffocated
by the exhalation of the sulphur, began to sneeze.
The husband, who attributed these sneezings to his
wife, returned the civilities dne upon such an occa·
sion; but their repetition having convinced him of
his error, he abruptly quits the table, and overturns
the bas-ket which covers his rival. The scene was on
the point of becoming truly tragical ; but the coun-
tenance of the poor wretch, who was nearly suffo-
cated, disarmed, in some measure, the fury of the
husband, aud he was suffered to escape without far-

ther barm-’² We learn from this anecdote, also, that
osier or wicker baskets were in use among the an-
cients: that, in the instance before uS, they were
applied to the same purpose as among the moderns,
and were of the same conical form: vimenea cavea—
fustium flexu in rectum aggregata cumulum.

The last operation of our linen and woollen manu-
facturers is that of giving their cloths a gloss. the-
ther or not the ancients placed them, for this pur-
pose, as we do, between heated metallic plates‚ is
uncertain3 but, at least, they put theru in press.
The press employed for this purpose was denomi-
nated by the Greeks, ιπο-ῑ, and, by Seneca, tormen-
tum. The latter writer informs us that it was used as
a domestic instrument on this very same account;
viz. that of glazing or glossing lineri, or woollen cloths.
Placet—non ex arcula prolata vestis, non mille pon—
deribus, aut tormentis splendere cogentibus pressa.
lib. vii. 12. ‘⁶ Ῑ do not like the garments which are
so carefully preserved in a wardrobe, and which are
forced into a gloss by the imposition of a thousand
weights‚ or the use of torturing machines,¹' (tor-
menta). In this passage, we meet with two modes
of glazing: and if that of weight or pressure be not
widely different from the modern screw-press, the
tormentum, or torturing machine, which was pro-
bably the real ι’,τος of the Greeks, and, consequently,
a heavy beam or roller, might have some resemblance,
in the mode of its use, to the rollers of our modern
