thrown back from every luminous object towards the
organ ofvision, and which, in the same manner, by its
stimulus upon the optic nerve‚ creates the sensation of
sight: we have an emanation of light instead of an
emanation of pellicle. But, ἁ priori, is it not as
difficult to conceive, that the fine and attenuate
matter of light should thus travel through, perhaps,
miles of resisting air, uninjured and in undeviating
succession, before it reaches the field of vision, as
that a rare and perpetual efflux of the matter of the
parent obje:t itself should do the same ?—The fluid
of light again radiates at 311 times. we are told, in
diverging and parallel lines from every point of the
luminous body that emits it : but the crystalline hn-
mour of the eye, and indeed all other convex lenses
whatsoever, possess a peculiar and extraordinary
power over· this attenuate fluid, and bend the whole
pencil of its mys that are reflected from the disc of
the object sur-veycd, even at a considerable distance
from itself, from a diverging to a converging direc-
tion, till at length, however broad the sui-face from
which they are thrown off, provided they be within
the measurement of a right line from the pupil, they
are concentrated into one point or focus, and in this
collective state enter· the lens itseli'. l do not con-
tros-ert these facts: experience has confirmed them
beyond all power of disbelief; but I contend, that
ὸ priori, without the testimony of such experience‚
there would be as much difficulty in bringing the mind
to accredit this principle ofthe modern system of op-
tics, as that invented by the atomic philosophers of
Grcece.—Perhaps,one of the most mysterious parts of
the Nexvtonian theory iz the doctrine which asserts tlte
inversion of the picture os objects in passing through
the σοι-ηας nor is the explanation either of Kepler
or Berkeley altogether satizf.=ctory. The crystalline
humour of the eye is declared to form an optical
convex lens of most exquisite workmanship, and not
differi-ag, in any point, from the common properties of
convex lenses extraneous to the body. Itis 3 decided
fact, that the rays of reflected light, which convey
the picture of an object through an artilicial convex

lens, are not only concentrated to a focus, but, in
consequence hereos, cross each other at their ceutral
point or axis of resi-aetion, and totally invert the or-
der of the picture they convey, so that the upper
part of it, when thus surveyed, becomes the lower,
and the right side changes place with the left; in
passing through a second convex lens, the true dis·
position is resumed, for the second correcta the error
of the first3 and if a third be employed, we are
again deceivcd, and the image once more appears in-
verted. If, then, it be a fact that the crystalline of
the eye possess all the common propertien of the ar-
tificial convex lens, it followe, as an indubitable con·
clusion, that nothing in nature is beheld aa it actually
exista, but every thing in a mode precisely contrary
to its true position: that what Ι see ou my right
hand is, in reality, on my left3 that the heavens, in-
stead of being above me, are below, and the earth,
instead of being below, is above; or, rather, that we
give a wrong and converse interpretation to these
opposite ter-ms. Such 3 doctrine must, at least, ap-
pear extraordinary to the multitude : but it is a doc-
trine which flows inevitably from the modern the-
ory of optics ; and which must be contended for, or
the theory itself be abandoned. Kepler, Dea (ἴω-ἰεῦ,
and Newton, have 311, therefore, contended for it;.
and their ingenuity has been at work for an expla-
nation of the apparent incongruity it offers. We
are told, that although the deception exists, the
uniformity of our habit and experiencc correcte the
evil that would otherwise follow. That the heavens‚
itis true, are painted to the eye itself as downwards,
and the earth as upwards, but that from habit, and
the examination and correction of our other senses,
we are led to iuver-t the picture in our own minds,
to transfer its features to opposite points, and to ad-
mit the idea of downwards to that part of it which
is exhibited upwards upon the speculum of the eye
itself, and the idea of lest to that which is pre-
sented to the right. The explanatione of Lu.
cretius are ingenious, but not always satisfactory:
this is also an ingenious explanation, but does'it
