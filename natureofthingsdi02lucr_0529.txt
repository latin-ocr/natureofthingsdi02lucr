,Boon VI. THE NATURE OF THINGS. 515

As shakes the frame, through every limb convuls'd,

When cold severe assaults us unprepar'd. 615
A two-fold terror, then, mankind appals;

Above, the buildings menace, and, below,

The shudd'ring ground threats instant into depths

Boundless to sink, or ope its giant jaws

And, in a moment, swallow all that lives. 620
E’en those who hold that heav’n and earth exist

Each incorrupt, and of eternal date,

Touch’d by the present danger, then betray
Strong latent dread lest earth forsake their feet

Down plunging headlong to th’ abyss below; 62 5
Lest nature fail, and, o'er the total world,

Void of all bounds promiscuous ruin rush.

Next why the main o'erflows not let us solve.
And, first, man wond'rous deems it the hoarse fall
Of mountain-catamets, the ceaselcss press 630
Of streams innum'rous from innum'rous po'1nt5,
Year after year, its limits never swell.
Yet add to these whate'er from heaven descends

In show-ers and τρυφαῖς, scattcr‘d wide alike
