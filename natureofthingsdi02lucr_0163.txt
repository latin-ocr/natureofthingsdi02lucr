THE· NATURE OF THINGS'.

He hears entranc'd‚ from every fluent string

Speaking empassion’d ; he the throng surveys,

And all the pageantry the drama boasts.

Of such vast import are the plans pursu’ct‚

The thoughts indulg'd, the eustoms deep impress’d-

Of man not merely, but of brutes as well,-

to sleep. If this coldness be prex-ented, by removing
them to a greater degree of artifieial heat, they will
all pass through the winter without more sleep than
in the summer time. If, during their torpidiry‚
the cold be increased to a very intense degree, the
vital functione, which in a smaller proportion of cold
always exhibit a diminishcd action, will then be to-
tally destroyed, and thc animal die of course. And
if, on attempting to recover it from its slumber, we
suddenly ernploy an intemperate proportion of beat,
it will die as readily as from an undue degree ofcold.
Experiments upon the swallow, cuckoo, and common
ssy, have abundantly confirmed the trnth of these ob-
servatione: and at the same time proved, that the
exhaustion of the mechanical parta of the system,
‘during‘sleeffi is so small as to require little or no as·
sistance from foods of any kind.

Perhaps all animals› under certain circumstances,
would exhibit the same phaenomenon ; at least,
there are various facts which indicate that it is
not foreign to the nature of man himself. To-
warde the termination of a long typhone sever,
when life has for several days been alone supported
by the almost incessant administmtion of wine, or
other cordials‚ sleep will sometimes supervene, and
continue without interruption for the space of twelve.
or even four and twenty hours·, and the patient,
on awaking, instead of sainting away, in coristquence
of his long abstinence, will feel far-more refrcshed and
invigorated than before he fell into his slumbcr. Du —
ring profound slecp, therefore, to whatever term it be
pmtractcd, little or no nutrxmcnt appears to be re-
quisite. The torpifymg power of cold is well known:
esen in our own country, bnt especially ux latitud-:s

that are still more frigid, we often hear of many a
poor wretch who falls a sacrifice to it during the rr.-
tensit'y of* winter. Now, in all such cases, the symp-
tom that immediately precedes a total cessation of
life, is· an unconquerable inclination to sleep. lf
this sleep be indulged, where the cold is extremely
severe, death must be the inevitable consequence:
but if the common frigidity of the atmosphere be
less, or any accidental circumstance occur to diminish
its intensity‚ should it be very violent, the sleep in-
duced, like that of animals accustomed to hybernal
torpidity, may not be fatal, and the very slnmber
into which the sufferer is t'hrown will enable him to
survive for weeks, or perhaps months, without the
assistance of sustenance of any kind.

These observations will tend to explain two well
attested, but extraordinary histories which have latcly
been published to the world of persons actually placed
in such asituation, and with a similar result. The
one is of a farmer’s wife near Cambridge, who lost
her road in returuing from market in the winter-time,
and was dug out alive, after having been bur-iad un-
der large drifrs of snow, and without any nutriment,
for elcven or twrlvc days: and the other, of a wo-
man near Lichfreld, who continued in a similar situn-
tion, and with as little injury‚ for fifteen days. In
both these caue, the cova-ring of the snow defended
the unfortunate suffert-rs from such a degree of frost
as must otherwise have proved fat-213 but the cold
they endan-d was still suffit-{tut to torpify th m, or
