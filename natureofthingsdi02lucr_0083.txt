THE NATURE OF THINGs,

For nought more arduous than to sever forms

True, from ideal by the mind begot.

, XVI-so holds that nought is known, denies he knows

E'en this, thus owning that he nothing knows.

With such I ne'er could reason, who, with face

Retorted, treads the ground just trod before.

fidently urged as to atti-act the attention of men of
real science, if we were not witnesses of the very
same fact in medem times. Thus, the system of
Berkeley lies under a like imputation of questioning·
the knowledge οἱ the senses,—because‚ by one bold
position, it denies the existence of the external
world, and, consequently, allows the senses nothing
to exercise their knowledge upon. But the system
os Hume ia still more danger-oue, in as much as it is
more perplexed and complicated3 for, while it ad-
mits the knowledge of the senses, it contenda, that
this knowledge is at all times imperfect, and, in many
instances, not at all to be depended upon. A tenet,
indeed, which he applies, with no small degree of
dexterity‚ to undermine the existence of our Saviour's
miracles, and to prove, that the apostles were de-
ceived by their senses while in the very act of behold-
ing such miracles performed. To every sophism of
this description, and to all the farrago of absurd
opinions which are built upon such external delusions,
by the sceptical philosophists with which the present
day abounds‚—the truly logical and legitimate chain
of argument before us offers a complete refutation ;
and, consequently, cannot be too highly valued.

 

Ver. 489. thus owning that he nothing [ποῖαι]
Butler thus ludicroualy :illudes to the sect here dc-
ucribcd in his Hudibras:

—those Athenian sceptic owls
'l'hat will not credit their own Βοιὼ ;
But measuring all things by their own
Knowledge, hold nothing’s to be known.
P. ll. iii. 803.
The corresponding verses in the original occur thus :

 

Denique, nihil sciri si quis putat, id quoque nescit,
An sciri possit ; quoniam nihil scire fatetur.
Ver. 471.

Our poet's contemporary and friend, Catullus,
may, possibly, from this couplet, have derived the
following:

Ipse quis seit, utrum sit, an non sit, id quoque
nescit :

a verse, however, which Longepierre is rather dis-
posed to refer to the ensuing of Anacreon, in an Ode
beginning Λεγοισιν αι Ὑυναικες :

Εγω δε τας nopae μιν
Ειτ’ elo-iv, ειτ’ αωηλθον
Ουκ’ οιδα· τουτο 3' οιδοο

Ως τω γεροντι μαλλων, &c.

Whether my hairs remain, or whether

My locks have left me altogether,

I know not this ‚· but this I know,

That he whose head is crown’d with snow
should doubly dance, and play and kiss,
Since death must call him soon from bliss-

Ver. 490. who, with siu-e
Retorted, treads the ground just trad besara]
1 have no doubt that Mr. Wakefield has restored the
true reading of the original os this passage ; and he
is justified by a variety of authentic manuscript co-
pies :

 

Qii capite ipse suo in statuit vestigia sese.
ln all the common εάίιίοης, we mett with it thus:
Qi capite ipse sno institnit vestigia ’τη-ο.
Upon this general muling it is diffitnlt to under-
stand what the poet would intend. Des Com-arcs
