that more than one man and one woman were created
in the beginning, who became the common parents
of all the human race: for there can be no doubt
that Moses was himself sirmly persuaded of the crea-
tion of a multiplicity of pairs of every other order of
unimals at the same time, and intended to convey
such an idea in his history ;' although with a view of
throwinga greater degree os harmony into the whole
representation, this has been denied by Mr. Kirwan
and some other modern philosopliers, who have con-
tended, but 1 think idly, that it does not appear,
upon the Mosaie statement, that more than an indi-
vidnal pair of different classes of animals of any kind
was generatcd at first ς the rest like the human racc
being the progeny of one common stock.

'If we look abroad into the world at large, there
is such an amazing difference discoverable, both ex-
ternally and internally, in the form, the colour,
and the mental powers of the numerous varieties of
man, that though it be by no means sufficient to con-
vince myself of separate and distinct origins, yet I
am not surprized that many modern philosophers
should have adopted this belief of the ancients, and
should endeavour to support it by various arguments
drawn from natural history, with which it does not
app-:ar that the zoologists of Greece were ever ac-
quainted. More especially, as by a little ingenuity,
they seem, at first sight, to make even the Hebrew
histor-ian a partizan with themselves: for, from the
time of Peyrerius, (Prae-Adamit. l. iii. 4.) it has
been successively asserted, by the espousers of this
doctrine, that Moses enumeratos two distinct riwes,
one of mankind in general, which occupied a part of
thesixth day's creation, andis related in the first chap-
ter of Genesis : and another ofAdam and Ere alone,
who were the immediate progenitors of the Hebrcw
racc. and which is not recorded till the sevcnth verse
of the second chapter: after which transaction, say
they, hc contines himself entirely to the history of
his mvn nation, or of those which were occasionally
connected with it. Neither is it easy, they adjoin,
to conceive, upon any other explanation, how Cain

could, in so earlya period of the world, have been
possessed of the mechanical implements of hus-
bandry, or what is meant by the fea:- he expresad
upon leaving his father's family after the murder of
Abel, that* every one who found hizn would slay
him: or his going forth into another country, mar-
rying a wife there, and building a city soon after
the birth of his first son. A morc cautious perusal
of the Mosaic account, however, will, I think, in-
contestibly prore that the narrative of the creation
of Adam and Ere, in the second chapter, is a mere
recapitulation of what occurs in the first, to which
the historian recurs, for the sole purpose of giving
a minuter description ofit. While as ῳ the exzstence
of artificers competent to the formation os the first
rude instruments employed in husbandry. and a con-
siderable popnlation os mankind scattered over the
regions adjoining that in which Cain resided at the
date of his fratricide. it should be recollected, that
the death of Abel did not take place till about a
hundred and twenty-nine years after the creation of
Adam ; for it was in the one hundred and thir-tietb
year of the latter that Seth was given to him in th:
place ofA bel: an intervaloftirne, undoubtedly, amply
sufficient, considering the primitive fecundity of both
animala aud vegetables for the multiplicatiori of the
racc of man to an extent of many thousand souls.
On such a view of the subject‚theref‹›re, one individua!
pair should seem altogether sufficient sor the pur-
pose of peopling the earth at large: and the epoch
which uve may suppose to have elapsed prior to the
notice of agricultural instruments of any kind, mus-t
have been amply long enough sor their first rude in-
vention. Το multiply canses without necessity is in-
consistent with the operations ofnatnre, and the true
principles of philosophy. The variati-ms in the struc-
ture, colour, an'l mental cndowinents os the dut*-
ferent nations os mankind, require no such distinct
and separate origin, sor they may be all legitimately
referred to the common operation of different cli-
mates. disserent customs, and different modes of

etlncation.
