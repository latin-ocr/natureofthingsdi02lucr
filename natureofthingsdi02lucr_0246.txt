DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. V.

Nec jacere indu manus, via (μᾶ munita fidei

Proxuma fert humanum in pectus, templaque mentis,

Sed tamen ecfabor: dictis dabit ipsa fidem res

1³01·sitan; et graviter terrarum, motibus ortis,

Omnia COHqUZlSSle'l in Pssl'VO temPOl‘C cernes:

Quod procul a nobis flectat Fortuna gubernans ς

Et ratio potius quam res persuadeat ipsa,

Subcidcre horrisono posse onmia victa fragore.

Qu& prins adgrediar quam de re fundere fata

Sanctius, et multo certft ratione magiS, quam

Pythia, quae tripode a Phoebi, lauroque, profatum

Multa tibi expediam doctis solatia dictis:

Religione refrenatus ne forte rearis,

Terras, et solem, et coelum, mare, sidera, lunam,

Corpore divino, debere aeterna meare:

Nor to the sight appeals it, wlio÷e award

We trust implicit, nor th’ es‘saying hands

VVhence chief conviction travels to the mind.

Upon which, anakefield, with his usual promp-
titude‚ refers us for a similar idea to St. John's first

“ That which
was from the beginning, which we have heard, which

Episde, cap. i. 1. δην arr' αρχης, &c.
we have seen with our eyes, which we have look-ed upon,
The
commentator upon Creech’s English version has very
aptly recalled our attention upon this subject, so far
at least as it relates to vision, to Milton's inimitable
apostrophe to light:

thus, with the year,

Seasons return, but not to me returns

and our hands have hamlled of the word of lise.’'

 

Day, or the sweet approach of ev'n and mom,
Or sight of vernal bloom, or summer rose,

Or flocks or herds, or human face divine:
But cloud instead5 and ever-during dark

Surround me, from the cheerful ways of man
Cut off3 and, for the book of knowledge sair,
Presented with an universal blank

Of Nature’s works, to me expung’d and rased ς
And wisdom al one entrance quite shut out.
