DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. VI.

Intima pars hominum vero flagrabat ad ossa;

Flagrabat stomacho flamma, ut fornacibus, intus:

Nihil adeo posses quoiquam leve tenueque membris

Vortere in utilitatem: ad ventum et frigora semper,

In fluvios partim gelidos, ardentia morbo

1170

Membra dabant, nudum jacientes corpus in undas. ν

Multei praecipites nymphis putealibus alte

Inciderunt, ipso venientes ore patente:

Insedabiliter sitis arida, corpora mersanS,

sEquabat multum parvis humoribus imbrem.

Nec requies erat ulla mali:

1175

defessa jacebant

Corporag mussabat tacito Medicina timore:

Quippe patentia quom totiens, ardentia morbis,

Lumina vorsarent oculorum, expertia somno3

Of the sacer iguis, or erysipelas, here spoken of,
Celsus enumerates two distinct species, de Re Medic.
vi. 8.: one in which there is an eruption redfflsh, οι·
slightly red, highly irrimbk, and accompanied with
permanent and extremely diminutive vesiclcs equable
in size 3 the other, consisting of a mere efflorescence
of the skin, unprominent‚ sahlind, and irregular in
its diffusion.

Ver. 1212.

 

nor would once andare
‘The Iigldts! vcsl thrown loosely o’er the limbs.]
Whence dwbdess, Ovid:
Non stratum, non ulla pati velamina possunt.
Μετ. vii. 558.

Nor warmth of bed, nor raiment would they bear.

 

Ver. 12 ις. in the gelid stream

Plunging their flery bodies„ to be cool’d :] Dio-
dorus Siculus relates this fact in almost the same
tet-ms, lib. xii. And Thucydides asserta, that many
of the sick made such attempta, and would have
thrown themselves headlong into· the wells and rivers,
if they had not been suddenly prevented. To which
he adds, that it seemed altogether amatter ofindif-
fercncc whether they drank much σι’ little; such

was the insatiable thirst with which they were tor-
tnented. Ἥδιστα. τε
