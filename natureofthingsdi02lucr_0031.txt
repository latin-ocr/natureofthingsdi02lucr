Boox lv, THE NATURE OF THINGS.

While as the walls, with ampler shade repel
The garish noon-beam‚ every object round
Laughs with a deeper dye, and wears profuse
A lovelier lustre‚ ravish'd from the day.

As then the trembling d·rapery ejects
Hues from its surface, superficial too

From every substance effigies minute
Must stream perpetual, each alike discharg’d.
And hence from all things vestiges there are
Of subtlest texture hov’fing through the void,
All sight evading when but simply pour’d.
Each essenee, yapour‚ fume, or aught alike
Attenuate, hence alone fiows void of form,
That, gender’d deep within, through tortuous paths
Loose, and disjoin’d, it struggles to the day3
While the light quintescence of utmost hues

Streams unobstructed as supremely plac’d.

The main, moreo'er‚ the mirror, or aught else

Of polish’d front, each object full reflects

θαι-ηις, aguarda, presumida rosa, Now laugh amid thy leaves-but know
Y en la piedad de Mayo no confles ; 'l‘hy beautcous ruin thence §li-ill fluw.
