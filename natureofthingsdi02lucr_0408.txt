DE RERUM NATURA}

Lm. V.

Cum validis pariter legionibus, atque elephantis;

Non divom pacem votis adit,

ac prece quaesit

Ventorum pavidus paces, animasque secundas?

Nequidquam : quoniam, violento turbine saepe

1230

Conreptus‚ nihilo fertur minus ad vada leti.

Usque adeo res humanas V1s ABDITA quaedam

Ver. 1256. And templs the gods with vows, and
prays, aghast,
For winds appeas'd, ] Thus, M. de Saint
Lamban, admirably describing a rain and thunder·
storm, in his poem of The Seasons τ

 

La peur, l'airain sonnant dans nos temples sacres,
Font entrer ἒι grands flots les peuples e'ga‘lres.
Grand Dieu ! vois 'a tes pies leur foule consterne'e
Te demandet le prix des travaux de l' annee. :
Helas! d’un ciel en feu les globules glacds,
Ecrasent‚ en tombant, les epis renversfis.

Le tonnerre et les vents dechirent les nuages;
Les ruisseaux, en torrens, devastent leurs rivages.
O recolte ! o moissons! tout perit sans retour:
L’ouvrage de l’anne‘3e est de'truit dans un jour.

Fear‚ to the brass·resounding temple drives,

Flood after flood, the crowd that scarce survives.

O God ! behold them at thy feet deplere

Their ruin’d hopes, their harvests now no more.

Lo! the harsh hail-storm, from the heav'ns on
fire,

Faus 0’er the glebe, and roots each rustick
spire.

Thunder and whirlwind rend the clouds in twain 3

The delug'd streams exundate every plain.

Fruits of the fields Ξ O treasures doubly dear,

One day destroys the bounties ol' a year.

This i< highly spiri'ted; and it shews how well
the =ariter was acquainted with the Seasons of oui·
own excellent countryman Thomson. I beg the
readcr to compare this passage, and much that pre-
cedes it, if he be in possession of the poem, with the
Autumn of the English bard, from ver. 3¹¹ to 343.

Ver. 1260. So,srom his awsul shades some Pown
vasten] These verses baffle all commenda-

tion: they are equally energedc, sublime, and true.
They are full of the existence of a supreme controlling

power, while, with becoming modesty, they pretend

not to a knowledge of his essence or qualities. To
our poet he was conceakd, invisible, unknown, vis
ΔηοιτΑ QUAEDAM ; but his effects were obvious and
incontrovertible. Who of us, without presumption,
can pretend to a more intimate knowledge of him in

the present day ?

Usque adeo res humanas vis ΑΒυιτΑ quasnam
Obterit ς et pulcros fasces, saevasque secures,
Proculcare, ac ludibrio sibi habere, videtur.

There can be little doubt that Virgil had hie eye
directed to this exalted passage in the following verses:

Ipse pater, media nimborum in nocte, corusca
Fulmina molitur dextra : quo maxima motu
Terra tremit, fugere sent, et mortalia corda
Pergentes humilis stravit pavor] GEORG. i. 328.

Great Jove himself, whom dreadful darkness shrouds,

Pavilion'd in the thickness of the clouds,

With lightning arm'd, his red right hand puts forth,

And shakes with burning bolts the solid earth ι

The nations shrink appall’d 3 the beasts are fled ;

All human hearts are sunk and pierc'd with dread.
Wawrou.

This description, however, fine as it is, is far ex-
cellcd, as Dr. Warton has justly obsewed, by the
following οἶ the Psalmist‚ xviii. 12. in which,
after representing the Almighty as flying upon the
wings qs the wind in the midst of a norm, he adds:
