THE NATURE OF THINGS.

Blows with perpetual winnow; every surge

Hence loiters slow, the total current swells,

And wave o'er wave its loftiest bank· surmounts.

For that the fixt monsoon that now prevails

Flows from the cold stars of the northern pole

None e’er can doubt; while rolls the Nile adverse

Full from the south, from realms of torrid heat,

he state the precise latitudes whence these rivulets
originate. His description is too short and general
for such minute particulars, but it is at the same
time so pointed and characteristic, that, had our own
countryman Bruce travelled with no other instructions
in his pocket than what the present account of Lu·
cretius affords, he could scarcely have failed in his in-
vestigation, or deviated from his proper course. He
tells us, that it originates in the south, in realms that
lie near the burning heat of the equatur, and are in-
habited by the negro-tn'bcs of Ethiopia :

Ille ex aestifera parte venit amnis, ab Austro
Inter nigra virum percocto secla colore:

to which he adds, that its extreme springs lirst
bubble forth still nearer to the line:

Exoriens penitus media ab regione dici.

These springs are now found to originate in about
the twelfth degree of north latitude: and it is highly
probable, that, in the two former verses, our poet
refers to their first collection in the lake Dambea ;
for, notwithstanding the general want of success
with which this subject was investigated iu ancient
times, it is obvious, from this history of Lucretius,
that much genuine and accurate knowledge was ac-
quired in the aggregate ς and there can be no doubt
that thie very lake had been actually explorat-d.
Ptolemy makes mention, indeed, of two lakes in
this ¹very quartu, whence, he asserta that the Niu-
originates3 but the testimony of Pliny is more aa·
tisfactory still. Nero, he tells us, Uist. Nat. νὶ. 6.
dispatehed two centuriam, accommodate-d with every

convenience, to ascertain the rise of this mysterioun
stream ι and adds, that on their return hume, he ex-
pressly heard them assert, ad ulteriora quidem perveni-
mus, ad immensas paludeS, quarum exitum nec in.
colae noverant, nec superare quisquam potest, “we
at length reached some immense lakes, whose ter-
mination the bordering inhabitants were unacquainted
with, and which had baffled every possible inquiry.”
The magnitude of the Dambea, or as the natives of
Abyssinia denominate it, the sea of Tzana, which,
according to Lobo, is ninety miles long, and thirty-
six broad, and not less extensive according to Bruce.
calculating‚ at least, from his general map,-for the
statement in his text differs from the chart nearly a
degree in length,—might justify such an assertioni in
a people so extremely ignorant as those from whom the
Roman centurions obtained their insomnium and
beholding, as they must have donc, thi.» expanse oswa-
tcr intersectcd with a variety of islands, for the Dam.
bea contains not less than twenty-ene, they might
naturally conceive. that it commui us several, in·
stead osone indixidual lake.

lt is now worth while to compare this description

of our poet with the following ns ’[Ἰωιιιωιιε
