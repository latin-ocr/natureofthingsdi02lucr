THE NATURE OF THINGS.

With front oppos’d‚ now deep diffus’d behind,

Gend’ring fresh clouds, a monster each to view.

Mark, now, how swift such phantoms form—how swift r 50

Exhale from all things, and, when form'd‚ dissolve.

A steam there is that from the face of things

Pours forth perpetual.

This, when urg'd amain

On porous textures, as the cloaths we wear,

Pierces entire: when bold with wood, or stone

It dares conibet, the subtile membrane breaks,

Nor aught returns of semblance 3 but when flung

On dense and splendid objects (foremost such

For then nor pierces the light lymph, nor quick

Now sounds th’Almighty voice : th’ uprieer saints,

And melta, so seems it, into teat-s of saints,

in a fragment preserved by Diogenes Laertius, lib. x.

doctrine our poet elegantly illustrates by the pers:
tual reflection from mir-rurs, and other polishcd
substances, of the images propellcd against their sur-
face: these, not remaining an instant, but being
thrown back again into the surrounding atmosphtrc.
and as instantaneously succecded by fresh emana-

borrowed from the Grecian school: the only diff-tr-

accounts for the picture presented from an inc< mne
