cover from their exhaustion‚ and that the man would,
.in like manner, :iwake fro'n the total torpidity, the
sleep or death of the entire frame: but this is im-
possible; the soul has now deserted the body: a
change in every orgnn ensueS, and the whole system,
instead of reviving‚ becomes a prey to corruption
and ruin.

IV. then the organs of external sense have re-
cruited themselves by repose‚ the stimulus that rouses
the one, rouseS, at the same time, the rest, from a
From the same habit, the tor-
pidity produced by exhaustion, in any single urgan,
is propagated through every other, and the sleep be-
comes common to the whole τ although it is also un-
questionable, that the whole are also fafigued, or
partially exhausted, from the fact, that the general
stock of sensorial power has been borrowed, in a
considerable degree, from the rest, and expended at
τι single outlet.

V. The nervous fibi-ils, or rather, tubules of the
external organs of sense, are equally affected, and, of
course, become equally exhausted, whether the sti-
mulus be applied at either end, to wit, the end ter-
ininating externally‚ or that connected with the
brain; and hence, internal excitements, as those of

habit of association.

severe study‚ intense grief, unduc eating and drink-
ing, or febrile diseases, produce the same effect as
causes operating from without.

VI. In either case, the sleep or torpidity pro-
duced is sound or healthy, under a certain degree of
exhaustion alone : hence mankind sleep most re-
freshingly after moderate or accustomed fatigue, mo-
derate or accustomed study, moderate or accustomed
meals.

VII. If the stimulus be a little increased beyond
this medium, the vital organs themselves become af-
fected, an nndue and morbid proportion of sensorial
power is secreted‚ which postpones the torpidity or
slecp for the present, but at the expence of the general
strength of the whole system ς which, in conse-

quence, becomes gradually moi-e exhausted and de-
bilitated: whence a far deeper torpidity, or sleep,
must necessarily ensue at length, than-would have
occurred in the first instance. If such torpidity take

-place before the vital organa are totally exhausted‚

it is confined to the external organs of sense alone,
which hereby progressively recover their accustomed
activityand vigour: if the vital organa be them-
selves altogether exhausttd, before the torpidity en·
sues, it is propagated to themselves, and the conse-
quent sleep is the sleep of death. Violent and long-
continued labour, as an external stimulus, violent
and long-continued study, violent and continued fc-
vers, violent and continued grief, a very inordinate
debauch, as intemal stimuli, are equally liable to pro-
duce the effects here specified : and the one or the
other will take place in proportion to their excess
and extremity.

VIII. 1f the stimulus affecting the extemal organa
of sense, at which end soever it be applied, be in-
tolerably pungent or forcible, the senson‘al power ἰς
exhausted immediately, and the organ directly af-
fected becomes instantly torpid. Hence sounds, in-
snfferably lond, make us deaf ; excessive light makes
us blind; acrimonious smells, or savours, render uo
incapable of smelling or tasting : and hence, an abrupt
shock of joy or grief, a sudden and intense paroxysm
of sever, large quantities of wine or spirits, as inter-
nal causes, produce coma, palsy, apoplexy, which
are only so many modifications of the sleep or tor-
pidity of the nei-vous tubules of the external organa
of sense. If the same abrupt and violent cause be
sufficiently powerful to act upon the vital organs as
well as those of exter-nal sensatim, the torpidity be-
comes universal, and the sleep induced is, once more,
the sleep of death.

IX. As violent stimulants produce sudden and ir·-
recoverable torpidity‚ either general or local, accord-

ing to the mode and place of applicatiom stimulants
less violent, induce a tendency to the same effect.
