“ Formerly fnllers, intertwining a bundle of thorns,
used it for napping their cloths.'' The thorny or
prickly planta, most commonly employed for this pur-
pose, are described by Dioscorides under the names of

To these thorns the fuller added also occasionally,

hedgc-hog. “ If it were n0t‚” says he, “for the
prickles of this animal, in vain would the luxurious
fleece of the sold have been given to mankind ε it is

lerum mollitia in pecude mortalibus data; heic cute
expoliuntur vestes. It is truly extraordinary‚ how-
ever, that the ingenuity of the aneients never intro-
duced to themselves the knowledge of the teazle. or
fuller's thistle‚ or urged them to the invention of
platea of iron books, which are now iu general use, Ι
believe, in this country, instead of the former; but
which, 'from the silence of M. Ameilhon upon their
construction, do not yet appear to have made their
way into ance, or at least to have superseded the
teazle. M. Ameilhon contends, that although they
never applied it to the purpose of vellicating stuss's,
they were, neverthcless, well acquainted with the
male, and that it is to be traced among the Greek
and Roman writers, and particularly Dioscorides and
Pliny, under the name of Διψακυς, or Dipsacus. The
DipsacnS. however, is a genus which comprizes a
considerable variety of species, of which the teazle
forms but one: the description os Pliny and Diosco-
rides, but particularly that of the latter, are very
correct uo sar as they extend ς and their delineatiou

of the little cisterna filled with dew, or rain-water,

 

and which are sni-med at every clavi-cle by the curva-
ture of a pair of leaves, is very minute 2 an admirable
confflvance, which is well known by modern bota·
nists to be for the purpose of drowning the little in·
sects which so numerously approach and encumber
it; considerable numbers of which are perpetually
traced in these pigmy pools of transparent lymph, the
taste of which appears to be deceitfully grateful to
the unwary crowds it dest1·oys; and which induet-d
the Greeks to bestow on the plant a second name,
and to call it λουτρον Αφροὲιτης (labrum Veneris, or
Venus-lip). But, notwitht-tanding the exquisite and
accurate descriptions, both of Dioscorides and Pliny,
neither of them make mention of that peculiar and
idiopathic character of the teazle‚ ils itzc1n··1·.1te‹lspines,
which distinguishes this speeies of Dipsaeus from se-
veral others of tjie same genus, and which alone ren-
ders it of exclusive value to the manufac-turer or ful-
ler. I cannot, therefore, agree with M. Ameilhon,
that the ancients were acquainted with the real
teazle, or that it is described either by Dioscorides
or Pliny: they were acquainted with the Dipsacus
as a genus, but not with this partieuiar species ofit 3
and it is the genus alone to which the description-3 of
these admirable botanists refer.

lt is doubted by⁴501ne critices, whether this branch
οῖ’ the woollm trude was known to the aneieuts: but
there is a passage in Lucian's dialogue of The Fugi-
rives, which seems to intimate that something of the
same kind at least was in common use among the
Greeks: sor he there speaks of a man os the name of
Cantharus, “ v· ho, sitting in the manufacturer’s work-
shops, sheured away whatever superfluous ssocks
