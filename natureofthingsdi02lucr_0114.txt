DE RERUM NATURA.

Mellis apeS, quam vis longe, ducuntur odore3

Volturiique cadaveribus: tum, fissa ferarum

Ungula quo tulerit gressum, permissa canum vis ·

Ducit ; et humanum longe praesentit odorem,

Romulidarum arcis servator, candidus anser.

Sic aliis alius nidor datus acl sua quemque

Pabula ducit, et a tetro resilire Veneno

Cogit3 eoque modo servantur secla ferarum.

Hicc' odor ipse igitur, nareis quiquomque lacessit,

Est alio ut possit permitti longius alter:

Sed tamen haud quisquam tam longe fertur eorum,

Quam sonitus, quam vox3 mitto jam dicere, quam res,

Sub terias, coelumque aestiva lucc reclusit ε
Ille continuo saltus silvasque peragrant,
Purpuerosque metunt flores, et flumina libant
Summa leves.

Thus admirably translated by Mr. Sotheby ι

Now when the sun, beneath the realms of night,
Dark winterdrives‚'and robes the heavens with light,
The bees o’er hill and dale, from flower to nower,
ln grove and lawn the purple spring devour,

Sip on the wing, and lightly brux-hing- lave

Their airy plumage in th’ undimpled wave.

Ver. 693.

desire of this animal for carrion is known, even to a

innumerable allusions to its attendance upon armie5‚
and other multittxdes, among whom there is a large
and perpetual moitality. Lucretius vrightly informs

dulity, attributes to them a sense of prescience, as
well as of acute sinell ς and assei-ts, Nat. Hist. x. 46.
that they fly to the scene of carnage three days
before it takes place, as if they had a presentiment of
the slaughter before the smell of the dead bodies at-
tracted them.”

In the Almazeniyyo‚ or Moallakat poem of the
Arabiam bard Zohair, there is an admirable personifi·
cation ofDeat11, who, on this account, is represented
as the mother of vultures:

“ He (Hosein‚ the son of Demdem) made a fierce
attack3 nor feared the number of tents where
Dea-rii, the mother of Vunrvus, had fixed her
mansion.” Sir Wssliam Jones. Δ

The vulture of the Greek and Roman barda is the
hawk os Ossian ; for the vulture is scarcely ever to
be met with in Britain or Ireland, and the hawk in
poetry answers the purpose just as well. Thus, in

his Berrathron: “ The hawks rush from all their

ble, if all naturalists had not remarked their peculiar wiuds; they are wont to trace my course. We re.
