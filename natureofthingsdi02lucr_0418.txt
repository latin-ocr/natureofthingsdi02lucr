DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. V.

Miscebant fluctus, et volnera vasta serebant,

Et pecus atque agros adimebant3 nam facile ollis

1290

Omnia cedebant armatis nuda, et inerma.

Inde minutatim processit ferreus ensis,

Vorsaque in obscenum species est falcis ahenae,

Et ferro coepere solum proscindere terrae3

Exaequataque sunt creperi certamina belli)

1295

Et prius est armatum in equi conscendere costas,

Et moderarier hunc frenis, dextraque vigere,

Quam bijugo curru belli tentare pericla.

Et bijugom prius est, quam bis conjungere binos,

Et quarn falciferos armatum adscendere currus.

Inde boves Lucas, turrito corpore, tetros,

Angu'unanos, belli docuerunt volnera Poenei

Subit-fre, et magnas Martis turbare catervas.

Ver. 1328. first, roo, on horse-back strove the mar-
rial chicf‚] The poet proceeds to inform us of

the first subjugation of the horse to the superior power
of man. In the earliest use of him he was mounted,
and afterwards harnesscd singly, doubly‚ and, last of
all, quadruply to the war chariot, of which tremcn-
dous instrument of slaughter an account has been al-
ready giveu iu Note on Book III. 652. The inven-
tion of the bruile, and riding on homcback, is ascribed
by Sophocles· to Neptune ς by Lysias, the orator, to
the Amazons3 by Virgil, to the Lapithae, a people of
Thessaly, inhabiting the mountains of Pindus and
Othrys and who, in consequence, must have been in
the immediate vicinity of the Centaurs‚ and perhaps
constituted the same nation. This last writer also

informs us, that the invention of the chariot of war is
to be ascribed to Ericthonius, but whether the
Phrygian or the Athenian chief of this name, he has
not decided : most probably, however, to the latter;
for Pliny makes a distinction between this Erictho-
nius and the Phrygiam», and attributes the invention of
the war-ehariot, with a single pair, to the people of
Phrygia, and that with a double pair to Erictho-
nius himself. Hist. Nat. vii. 56. “ Rigas primum
junxit Phrygum natio, quadrigas Ericthonius.” The
passage of virgil, which contains this history of
equestrian tactics, occurs in his Georgics, aa fol-
lows :

Primus Erichthonius currus et quatuor ausus

Jungere equos, rapidisque rotis insistere victor.
