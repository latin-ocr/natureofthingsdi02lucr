sor a proof that Epicurus was actually deified by his
followers, and adored with religious worship : “ Qae
quidem cogitans, soleo saepe mirari nonnullorum inso-
lentiam philosophorum‚ qui naturae cognitionem ad-
mirantur, ejusque inventori, et principz' gratias exsul-
tantes agunt3 cumque venerantur ut deum: liberatos
enim sc per eum dicunt gravissimis dominis. Quaest.
“ While thus meditating, I often
wonder at the insolence of some philosophers, who
are astonished at their knowl:dge of nature, and ex-
ultingly give thanks to the chief and inventor qftln's
knowledge ; and worship himas a god, because he has
freed them, as they tell us, from the most tyrannic

masters.’'

Cicero, who was himself initizited at an early age
into the philosophy of Epicurus, must have known
this assertiou to have been equally false in fact, and
inconsistent with every principle of the Epicurean
hypothesis at the time he wrote it. But new con-
verts make the warmest espousers of every cause;
and hence, aster he had foi-zaken Epicurus for Zeno,
he was at all times immoderntc'y len-ish in abusing his
first saith. Upon this subju-t, I must intreat the
render to return, sor fuller insui-martion, to the pre-
fixed Istfe of Lucretius. where he will sind that

its tenets; for that Cassius well kuew he wasperfectly
aware there was no foundation for such opprobrium
in the tenets themselves.

This unauthorized abuse of the Stoic philosopher-s,
however, has been greedily laid hol'd of, and improved
upon by multitudes in modern times; and it has
been ingeniously added to the original tale, that Epi-
curus himself, during his life-time, proudly looked
forward to the possession of divine honour at his
death3 although not an individual serap of written
authority can be advanced in support of so daring
an assertion-although it would have instantly sub·
vei-ted his whole system to have pretended to any
kind of apotheosis, and although Lucretius himself
has declared, in the most positive manner, that the
life of Epicurus is totally eminet, and that he moul-
dered away in his grave like the meanest of mortale.
See Book 111. 1082. Nevertheless, so general has
this unsounded assertion of Cicero, and the Stoics
at large been admitted, even among men of letters,
who ought to have known better, that Gassendi
has thought it necessary to enter into an elaborate
defence of Epicurus from this mendacious charge ι a
tas-k, indted, which he has executed with the com-
pletest success.—Can the reader conceive that Cicero,
after so much severity, has not only denominated Len-
tulus the politician, but even Plato the philosopher, a

no popular motive to excite any undue boldness osme-
