Boox 1V. THE NATURE OF THINGS. 47

We trace for ever when th’ attentive eye 280
Peeps in some hall, beyond th’ unfolded doors,

And through their visto marks the scene without.

In both a twin‚ a double tide of air

Strikes on the vision. In the mansion thus

First floats th’ interior ether, bounded close 285
By the broad portals opening right and left,

Then light external, and another air

Assail the pupil, and the real scene

At last developeS. Thus the semblance too,

The mirrorsss self projects‚ as towards the sight 290
It yet, yet tends, the midway air protrudes

Plac’d twixt the visual orb, and object view-’d 3

Whence first th' aerial tide assaults us ere

Conspicuous springs the mirror3 which survey'd,

Next instant flows the semblance from ourselves 295
Ceaseless exhal'd, and from the splendid plate

Reflected punctual, visiting in turn

The sentient eye—hall, and in turn its tide

Of ai‘r first forcing o’er the goaded view ;

Thus doubly distant, and the glass beyond 300
Painting the mimic image we discern.

Hence not the meanest marvel can attach

To forms reflected from the fulgent plain

Through two—sold aits, by the twin tide resolv'd„
