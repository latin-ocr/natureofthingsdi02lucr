THE NATURE OF THINGS.

E’en in the sweets Hyblaean honey boastS.

But come, for 0D0URs call us, and the powers

That sway th’ obsequious nostrils.

Odours fine, 690

Wave after wave, How forth in ceaseless tide

From many a substance, many a living tribe

Attracting different, as diversely rear'd.

Hence bees, through distant ether, wind the scent

conjectures, they ascertain, by the sense of smell alone,
the bait which the fisherman holds out to them at a
distanee; a fact, however, which is doubtful, and
which M. Virey is rather disposed to attribute to
their keenness of sight.

It is accuratcly observed by Theophrastus, in his
treatise on odours, that every thing animate or inani-
mate throw⁸ forth some odour peculiar to itself. We
are not sensible of any such effluvium exhaled from
our own bodies, yet it is by this that dogs and other
quadrupeda chiefly distinguish their masters from
ntnngero. The Journal des Sqavans, an. 1667, gives

 

us, indeed, an in=tance of a monk who umus possessed
osa similar acuteness of amcll, and could ascertain,
by the difference of odour alone, the sex and age of
a person, the manner of life to which he was accus-
mmcd, aa also whether he were married or sssnggle.
thether this example, supported indeed by others
of a parallel tendency, be correct or not, it can
scarcely be doubted that quadrupeda in general, and,
perhaps, most other anivnals, are g1t'tcd with olfactory
powers of a similar description, and act upon the no-
tice thus communicated to thern.

lt is probabit. indeed, that the odours omitted hy
animala :ire quite as diversifica! as those exhaled from
vegetablcs, and in many instance-³ quite as agree-able.

obtained in a pure and conca-ntmtcd state. It iss-scs

The civet is the productiori of the civet-cat alone,—
the viverra zibetha, and the viverra cix-etta of Lin-
nc‘ns. There are, however, some species of cats that
yield it in a small quantity; while the castor fiber,
the sus tajassu‚ and many other species of swine, emit
an oduur of castor. Among insects, however, these
odours are cons³derably more varied, as well as con-
siderably more pleasant: sor the musk-scent of the
cei-ambit< moschatus, the apis fragrans, and tipula
moschifera‚ is far more delicate than that os the musk-
quadrupeds; while the cerambix suaveolens, and se—
veral species of the ichneumon yicld the sweetest per-
fume of the rose ; and the petiolated sphex, a balsa-
mic ether, highly fragrant, but peculiar to itself.
