Ver. 698. ,And day elongans, and the night cotug-gn]
For the variable length of the days and nights in the

different seasons, our poet offers three hypotheses.
The first' is the obliquity of the eclipfic, or path de·
scribed by the sun in his annualv voyage round the
world, as taught, indeed at the present moment, in
all our books on geography: for, though' ln the sci-
ence osastronomy, the Copernican systemis univ ersally
adopted, it is curious enough to obser rve that, in the
former rseicnce, the old theory of Ptolemy is yet, os-
tensibly at least, adhered to, and the sun is still re-
presented as travelling round the immovtable earth;

an absurdity which is infinite-ly perplexing to chil-

dren, and which cannot too soon be relinquished.
While this mode of education, however, prex-aiis, our
poet will easily be understood, and his accurate and
elegant delineation be duly appreciated without a
comment, even by beginners. The other two hy-

potheses he enumerates as taught in his own day, are

far more wild and unphilosophic. ‘IJhe one supposes
thss-Qphcee
than in other rs, jn parth-seaaonsofi-the year;

andin consequence hei-eof, that the sun is, at euch

times, conside rablx retarded in his diumal revolu-
tinn, and riscs in the east at a later honr in the

morning: and the other, maintained by Xenopha-
nes, Heraclitus, and all those who conceived that

 

the sun wsa a conglobation of fier] atoms dissi-

pated e vre y night, and renewed every morning, that
these fle ry atonS, in consequence of such different
de ns sity οἷ th ie atmosphere‚ at particular seasons of
the year, move forwards more slowly or swiftly, and
assemble and concentrate themselves at an earlier or

later honr, in proportion to the aerial resistance they
meet with.
