418 DE RERUM NATURA. Lm. V.

Et supera calamos unco percurrere labro:

Unde, etiam vigiles, nunc haec adcepta tuentur,

Et numeris servare genus didicere3 neque hilo

Majore interea capiunt dulcedine fructum,

Quam sylvestre genus capiebat terrigenarum. 1410

Nam, quod adest praesto, nisi quid cognovimus ante

SuaviuS, in primis placet, et pollere videtur3

Posteriorque fere melior res illa reperta

Perdit, et inmutat, sensus ad pristina quaeque.

Sic odium cepit glandis; sic illa relicta 1415

Strata cubilia. sunt herbis, et frundibus aucta.

Pellis item cecidit, vestis contempta ferina;

Quam reor invidia tali nunc esse repertam,

Ver. 1451. Than the rude qffrpring earth in wood-

lands borea] The whole passage is so beauti-

fully imitated by Thomson that 1 cannot refrain
from presenting it to the rcader:

The first fresh dawn then wak’d the gladden’d tace
Of uncon-upted man, nor blush'd to see
The sluggard slcep beneath its sacred beam.
So up they rose as vigorous as the sun,
Or to the culture of the willing glebe,
Or to the cheerful tendance of the flock.
Meantime the song went round : and dance and
sport,

Wisdom, and friendly talk, successive, stole
Their hours away. While in the rosy vale
Love breath’d his infant sighs, from anguish free,
And full replete with5bliss ; save the sweet pain
That inly thrilling but exalts it more.

Nor yet injurious act, nor surly deed
&Vas known among those happy sons of heav'n‚
For reason and benevolence were law.

Harmonious nature, too, look’d sntiiing on ;

Clear shone the skies, cool’d with eterna! gales,

And balmy spirit all. The youthful sun

Shot his best rays—-as o’er the swelling mead

The herds and flocks commixing‚ play’d secure.—

Soft sigh‘d the flute ; the tender voice was heard.

Warbling the varied beart ; the woodlands round

Applied their quire ; and winds and waters flow’d

In consonance. Such were those prime of days.

This kind of happy life is not the mere dream of
the philosopher or the poet : its type may occasion-
ally be found in nature, and it appears to have been
realized in the scenes of Yernen, or Arabia Felix. 1
enter not here into the geography of this delightful
country, or the causes that contribute to render it,
both frum its natural blessings‚ and the manners of
its mild and graceful inhabitants, the paradise of the
world: those who are anxious to be informed on
such subjects may consult, with great pleasure, Sir
W. Jones’s Essay on the Poetry of the Eastern Na-
tions. I shall only quote¹ on the present occasion,
