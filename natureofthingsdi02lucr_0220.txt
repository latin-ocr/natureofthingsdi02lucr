Usque adeo magni refert, ut semina possint

Seminibus commisceri genitaliter apta,

Crassaque conveniant liquidis, et liquida crassis.

Atque in eo refert, quo victu vita colatur:

Namque aliis rebus concrescunt semina membris,

Atque aliis extenuantur, tabentque, vicissim.

Et quibus ipsa modis tractetur blanda voluptas,

Id quoque permagni refert; narn more ferarum,

The corollary here deduccd is admitted, to it fullest
extent, into the theories of Buffon and Needham.
It is explained and established by similar premises,
and almost in the very words of the Roman bard.

Ver. 1324. Muci), eoo, concerns il what thesomls
employ'cl;] Thc truth of this axiom is, I be-

lieve, admitted by every physician and naturalist of
the present day. In a state of full and perfect
health, in which the digestive and generative
. organs are vigorous, and true to their own action. it
is probable, there is no food that can support life,
but may have a sufficient quantity of organic mole-
cules chylified and secreted for the ordinary purpose-s
of procreation ; and hence we may satisfactorily ac—
count for the population of the lower classes of the
multitude. But when the stomach or sexual organa
are debilitated, whether by disease or age, and a suf-
ficient quantity of organic elements arc not, in conse-
quence, secra-ted from the ordinary diet, it is then
necessary for the physic-ian to prcscribe a diet more

 

stimulative‚ either to the one or the other, or perhaps
to both. The effect of wine and cordials, that act
generally on the animal system, ia well known by the
experience of every day: but it is not improbable that a
great variety of medicaments exist, which are topically
stimulant‚and excite an increased secretiori of organic
molemles, by irritating the appropriate organs alone.
The principle which thus applies to man, applies
also to other animala with equa] force. Vix-gil has
not been unmindful of it, and has expressed himself
with such exquisite ele-gance of diction, and so pre-
cisely to the point, in his rules for the selection os a
colt to form the future stallion, that 1 am persuaded
1 shall not transgress upon the patience of my readers

by inserting both the original, aud the spirited vcr-
sion of ΜΓ. Sotheby.

His animadversis, instant sub ternpus; et omnes
Impendunt curas denso distendere pingui, Ι
Qrem legere ducem, et pecori dixere maritum:
Pubentesque secant herbas, fluviosque ministrant,
Ifarraque ; ne blando nequeat superesse labori,
Invalidique patrum referant jejunia nati.

Ipsa autem macie tenuant armenta volentes.
Atque ubi concubitus primos jam nota voluptas
Sollicitat, [rondesque negant, et fontibus arcent.
Saepe etiam cursu quatiunt, er sole fatigant 3
Cum graviter tunsis gemit area frugibus, et cum
Surgentem ad zephyrum paleae jactantur inanes.'
