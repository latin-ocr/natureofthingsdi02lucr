THE NATURE OF THINGS.

Steering the course th’ etherial breeze propels.

Nor wond’rous this3 for countless seeds of heat

Throng through the water, rais'd from earth profound,

And thence, in turn, projected into air:

Yet ne’er so active as the wave to warm.

Some latent energy the seeds, moreo'er,

Sudden, and there concentrates3 as, at times,

Springs the fresh fount amid th' unbounded main,

And drives the brine broad circling as it flows.

Nor thus unfrequent to the thirsty crew

Does bounteous nature ope the dulcet draught,

markable fountain of this kind, described by this too
credulous naturalist‚ is that of Arethusa in the western
part ofthe island ofOrtygia, which he asserts‚Lib. II.

nesus; a stream that, after a long passage through
the briny ocean, without mixing with it, dives sud-
denly beneath the surface of the carth, and, at length,
breaks out into this celebrated well-spring of fresh
water. To this same tradition Virgil alludus, AEn. iii.

whole as a fiction, Lib. VI.

springs of fresh water may burst forth from the bot-
tom of seas or salt lakes with so strong a projectile
force as to mount towards their surface without
blending with the briny flood,will not appear extraor-
dinary to those who have traced the existence ofoppo-

which, sec the Note on Book V. v. 526.) or have seri-

flames and lava from the very bottoin of unsarhornablc

created near Temen-a, one of the Azores, in December
