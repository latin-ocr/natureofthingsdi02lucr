THE NATURE OF THINGS.

Or, haply, still along the breezy air

It floats commingled ; whence, with every bresith,

Drink we alike the poison through our veinS.

And hence the murrain that assaults, at times,

The lusty herd, the blight that thins our flocks.

Nor aught imports it whether, urg'd by gain,
W e change the covering of the skies, and seek

Ourselves the no'xious climate, or its breeze

passage of the original, is different from that afforded
by any modern version with which I am acquainted‚
yet 1 have no doubt that it is what was intended by
the prophet himself. It gives a sense sar more mag-
nificent than that in common acceptation: is more

consonant with the context, and prevents the neces—

sity of arbitrarily supplying the verb it is, at the
opening of ver. 22, for which there is no authority

in the HebreW. Upon turning to the Septuagint,
1 find, also, that Ι am countcnanced in this render-

ing by the translation there offered, which, in v. 23.
runs as follows:

The beginning of ver. 24. obviously refers to the

graven images in v. 19. 20; and, in bold, metapho-
rical language, delineates their utter iinpotcnce and
vanity :

No—they shall not be planted: no—they shall
not be sown ς

No—their stock shall not take root in the ground 2

wither,
