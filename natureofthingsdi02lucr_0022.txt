Ver. 33.
poet is now entering upon the theory of exten-nal
perception, as unfolded in the code of Epicurus5
and however justly this theory may¹ have yielded to
the more accurate and applicable doctrine of the nlo·
dcrns, itis, neverthele55‚ so analogous to many of
the phaenomena of nature, and, as will be found in
(the sequel of the book before us, so rcadily‚ and, in
many instances, so satisfactorily explains the nature
and powers of exten-nal objects,'that it has ample
merit :md excellence enough to preserve it from obli-
vion: and, excepting in the two branches of optics
and acoustics, is, for the most part, still adhered to
by the different philosophers of the present day.

According to the theory of Epicurus, all the ex-
‘ternal senses are equally excited to action by the fric-
tion, upon their appropriate nerves, of some portion
>of the obje& perceived3 and which is perpetually,
for this purpose, ejecting some fine and attenuate
-effluvium from its own body, into the surroundxng
atmosphere. Thus, we acquire the sensation of [aste
- or smell by the friction of the sapid or olfacient par-
ticlcs of the substance smelt or tasted, upon the sa-
pid or olfactory nei-ves. But the Epicureans, not
satisfied with the application of this doctrine, ofa
perpetual effluvium to the sensesaof taste and smell,
:quvanced considerably farthen and endeavoured to
account for those of hearing and sight-upon the same

common principle. In consequence of which, they
contende-cl, that every one, in the act of speaking,
protrudes into the air an attenuate effluvium from the
sauces3'wliich, circulating in every direction, like
the odorous particles of the rose, or any other pcr-
fume‚ reaches, at length, the auditory nerves of the
by-standers‚ and excites the sensation of hearing:
and from this effluvium‚ or perpetual loss of sub-
stance, in the act of speaking, they ingeniously ac-
counted for that hoarseness and exulceration which
frequently attend upon the delivery of a long ha-
rangue. The same principle was applied to the ex-
plication of vision : and, as the doctrine of optics is
by sar the most important branch of the wide theory
of extet-nal perception, our poet commences with
this subject, and expatiates upon it more largely than
upon any of the collateral branches. The cffluvium
ejected from external objects is sometimes, he tells
us, totally broken and disconnected, as in the case
ofodours ; at other times, connected, in some degree,
although very loosely so, asin the instance of smoke
or flame: and, at other times again, perfectly con-
tinnous in its texture, although inconceivably deli·
cate and rare, retaining, like the cast-off skin of the
snake, a perfect image of the object from which it.
has been thrown, and, of course, exciting the optic
nerve to a sense ofits figure, as it at length impinges
against the eye, through the medium of the air„
