Ver. ι 292. Nor ever intersere the gods above
In stenes like these, the genial soil lock 11p,] The
general opinion of the present day attributes, as it
ought to do, the evil here complained of, to physieal
causes rather than to any immediate interposition of
Providence. In what those physical causes may con-
sist, where no organic deff-ct can be maced, it may
be difficult to determine; and different naturalists
and physicians will decide differently, according to
the system of generationi to which they arc attached.
But will any of them adduce a more probable theory
of obstructions than that the poet is now about to
enter upon. and in which he has been followed by
Buffon, Malpighi‚ and several other anatomic phi-
losophers ἓ
Among the Greek and Roman multitude, how-
ever, in the aera in which our poet wrote, the en-
lightened opinion of the present day, and for which
he strenunusly contcnds, did not prevail ς and the bane
of barrenncss was attributed to the immediate cin-sc
of Hcaven. This. indeed. was the belief, not only
of the Greeks and Romans. bnt of almost all the
Orientul nmions, and continuus to be so to the prc-
scnt moment, excepting, perhaps, among the priests

of the Bit-mans, who adhere to the sacred system oi
Buddha, znd cultivate celibacy with as mnch perti-
nacity as the monastic orders of the Church of Rome.
That the present was the popular opinion among the
Greeks, we learn from the following passage of
Homer :
σ-τυγερκς 8’ επεκεκλετ’ Epium,

Μηποτε ’γουνασιν &ww εἲεσεσῆκι edm ιἰον

E} εμεῧῑν -Ιεγοεκῑ-ἰ Θεοι δ’ ετελειον exarsum,

Ιι. 1. ⁴53.

And eries, “ Y: furies! barren be his bedx·
Inferna] J¹ovc‚ the vengeful fiends below,
And ruthl'css Prosci-plne, conlirm'd his vow.
