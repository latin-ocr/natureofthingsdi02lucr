DE RERUM NATURA„

Lm. IV.

Reddita sit, longo spatio ut brevis hora teratur,

In quem quaeque locum divorso numine tendit,

Suavidicis potiuS, quam multis, versibus edam :

Parvus ut est cycni melior canor, ille gruum quam

Clamor, in aetheriis disparsus nubibus austri.

Principio, persaepe leveis res, atque minutis

Corporibus stanteis, celereis licet esse videre.

In quo jam genere est solis lux, et vapor ejus ;

Propterea, quia sunt e primis facta minutis ε

Quae quasi cuduntur, perque aeris intervallum

Non dubitant transire, sequenti concita plag-31 :

Subpeditatur enim confestim lumine lumen,

Et quasi protelo stimulatur fulgure fulgur.

his annotatione upon Lucretius, has closely compared
the text of the latter with the venerable reliques of
Epicurus, as preserved by Diogenes Laertius, has
traced an observation to the same effect, commencing

Mau-chetti lias, in this instance, totally mistaken the
whole passage x

Parvus ut est cycni melior canor, ille gruum quam
Clamor, in aetheriis disparsus nubibus austri.

It is obvious, from the opposition of cycni to
gruum, that the term parvus is meant to imply small-
nest, or individuality contrasted with magnitude ‹11-

numbers; and not lownesr„ in opposition to loud-
ness. And it is equally obvious, that auster is used
synecdochally for the wind at large, from whatever
quarter it may blow: but the Italian version confines
it to the south only: “ the low song of the swan is
more grateful than the noisy clamour of cranes among
the clouds, when the εουτΗ wind agitaltes the great
fields of ether.”

Dal gridar, che le gme fan tra le nubi,

Se i gran campi dell’ aria austro conturba.

On the vulgar fiction of the music of the dying
swan, l liavc already animadverted, in Note on Book
111. v. 8., and noticed the fondness and frequency,
with which the poets of Greece and Rome recurred
to it as an emblem of their own musical powers.

In modern poetry‚ this application has not been
so generally exliibited, but a reference to the original
