DE RERUM NATURA.

Qui minus illa queant per magnos aetheris orbeis

AEstibus, inter se divorsis, sidera ferri ?

Concussos itere, et labefactos ae're multo;

actually find it in considerable and unincumbered por-
But, in
consequence of the perpetual obstructions of conti-

tions of the Atlantici and Etliiopic oceans.

nentS, mountains, and soils of different temperatures,
we must inevitably meet with a great variety of
winds in a great variety of places. Nevertheless‚ this
primary easterly wind is by far t'ne most prevalent over
the world at large. At the equator, it is, moreover,
pcreeired strongest 3 for in this quarter the air
is much more mre-fied than in any other latitude:
while, at the sanie tinne, on its north side, it inclines
to a northward directum and on its south, to a
southward.

But if this sontli-easterly or north-easterly wind
blow over a large tract of saud, as the deser-ts of
Lybia, for example, wli-:re the ullu-timi of the sun‘s
beams produces an int-:nse degree of litat, the column
ofair placed immediatelyon the surface of the saud will
be so rai-ested as to expanti in all directions, yet prin-
cipally upu'ards ; and the adjacent air froin the coldest
country will rush forn-ards to fill the comparative va-
cuum herc-by producud3 and the consequence will
often be, that wliilst. from the course of the sun, the
superior air, that lics beyond the retich of this inferior
hcat and rarefactum, (lours in one directim, and car-
ries the clouds that are horizontal with itself in the
same path, the air below will have a contrary tide,
and propel the clouds situatc in its own level to the
course it takes izsclf. And hence the origin of all
monsoons or trade-winds‚ which, but for the acci-
dental circumstance of local inferior heats, would
under-iatingly blow from the east, and which uni-
formly do so as soon as such local antagonists cease to
operam—A similar opposition of currente is justly

suspected in the ocean itself. See Note on ver. 526.
of the present Book.

Of the two opinions here stated by our poet, that
which represents the sun as encircling the earth, and.
producing the dawn by his regular return to the east

every morning, was most generally accredited, and
continued indeed to be so as long as the Ptolemaie
system was accredited itself. The other, which de—
lineates the solar orb as worn out and perishing at the
termination of the day, from the violence of his own
sire, and again periodically'renewed in the morning,
was, nevertheless, supported by no small number of
the sages of Greece and Rome, and is attributed to
Xenophanes as its autlior3 who added also that, in
like manner, the moon and stars were ignited bodies,
concentrated and enkindled at the close of the day,
and extinguished every morning. Heraclitus strenua
ously supported the same opinion : “ the sun‚’' said
he, “is renewed every day.’' Ἡελιος m,- εφ’ ‘up-spu
εστι. And, strange as such a doctrine may appear,
in the present age, it is not, perhaps, more wild or
incongruous than that which was universally current,
till within the last fifty years, that the sun was a lumi-
nous body of culinary fire, which had been for ever
burning from its first creation, without any diminu-
