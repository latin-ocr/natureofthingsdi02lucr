THE NATURE OF THINGS.

Nor strange, moreo’er, conceive it that the voice

F ull many a scene should pierce, the nerve of sound

Rousing, where sight's keen gaze can never reach.

F or voice unhurt through flexile tubes can wind;

But the light image never3 since the pore
When not direct, as that of lucid glass
Which all transmits, abrades it and destroys.-—

Voice through the total scene, too, spreads alike ;

Since, when once form'd, to vocicles minute

 

than in any other; and when once, by the use of
flexible tubes, thrown out ofa strait line, recovers it
as quickly as possible, and perseveres in the same di-
rection. Hence, a speaking trumpet, by being cur-
vated‚ may throw it to any quarter at pleasure ; and
the person directly opposite to the broad end of the
tube, will hear it at a very considerable distance, al-
though those immediately on each side ofthe tube
may be scarcely able to hear it at all, or at least but
very indistinctly. Yet even the person, who is di-
rectly opposite, will hear the projected sound with
much more force, and at such a distance from the
speaker as that no one near him shall hear it besides,
if be also be provided with a similar speaking-trumpct,
and convert it into a hearing-transpet, by applyiug tlie
narrow end of it to liis ear, instead osto his mouth ;
sor he will, in such case, sind, thrown upon his ear,
the whole concentmtcd volume of sound that the ex-
panded end of the tube is able to collect. If then,
into tlie figure introduced before the company,
one or more tubes of this description be inserted, ei-
tlier at their broad or their narrow end, and corn-
munic.rte together, and terminate in one common
opening, zui some part of tlie head, for example, is

sounds are thr-own into tlte tube by a speaker at the

other end of the trumpet, must necessarily follow the
course of the different tubes, be their deflection what
they may, and rusb forwards in a strait line from their
common opening ;—sliould such strait line point to-
wards the ceiliug, and a tube of similar description,
with its broad end downward, be inserted into the
ceiling, from a roorn above, so aa to catch the pro-
jected sound, it is obvious, that a pti-son concealed in
such upper room, with his ear applied to the tube, will
hear the words communicated fai· ruore forcibly thau
the byc-standers iu the lower room ; and it is equally
obvious, that, in consequence os its following the
same directiou conversely, tlie ausu‘er returned must
strike the ears of the listentrs to tlre different tubes,
that arc inserted into the ligure, much ruore power-
fully thau it can do thc cars of any other persons
whatever5 and that, u· such ans-wer bc not returned
very loudly, they· will be the only persons who will be
able to hear it at all. It is obvious also, that if it be
more convtnicnt to tlirow the sound into a room be-

low, or eveu on oue side ofthat in which tlie coin-

pany is collected,instead os through the ceiling, it may

be effected with cqual ease ς the aperture, burh iu tle

figure and in the wainscot. floor, or ccilmg, being re.

spectivclyeoirceulcd by some light cot-eiiug, which ntay
