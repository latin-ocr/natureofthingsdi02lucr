THE NATURE OF TIHNGS.

Then, too, how frequent things with power adverse,

Noxious to life, e'en man himself oppress.

Thus there are trees whose shade malignam strikes

With instant head-ach all, in idle hour,

Who loosely throw them on the grass beneath.

While some, o'er HEL1e0N‚ a blossom bear

Of scent so deadly, few the smell survive.

815

α These spring from earth ; for earth within her holds

Innum'rous seeds of things innum'rous, join'd

In countless modes, and yields them as they blend.

The midnight tapes, as its dying snuff

Pours o'er the nostrils, stupefies with sleep

Deep as, the hrain, when apoplexy numbs.

So stupid swoons the maid, too, who in hour

Of full, o'erflowing nature, castor gross

pose, the natives poison their arrows almost beyond
the power of recovery. And it has been demon-
strated, from actual experiment, that thepoison which
has thus becn communicated to the arton-s, will re-
tain its force for above an hundred years. The Bo-
hun Upaa of the island of Java, if the facts recorded
of it be true, is possessed of a power still more
strangely destructive than either of the above ; for,
not animals alone are said to become the prey of
its most fatal effluvium, but even every shrub and
blade of grass in its vicinity‚ so that wherevcr the
Upas springs up, it produces a barren desert to a
considerable extent around it, and ssourishes in stern
and gloomy solitude. It is, iiiiquestioimbly, a ‹lelc-
terious tree, but its effe-ets have been grossly exagge-
rated.
