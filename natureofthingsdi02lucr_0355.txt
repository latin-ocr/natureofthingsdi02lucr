Boon V. THE NATURE OF THINGS. 341

Earth claims most justly, since the tace of man 840
Long bore she of herself, each bruta] tribe
KVild-wandering o'er the mountains, and the birds
Gay-wing'd, that cleave, diverse, the liquid air.
Yet drew, at length, the moment when herself
Could bear no longer3 like her daughters since, 845
By age divested of parturient power.
For age the total world transforms, from state
To state for ever passing3 nought remains
Long its own like3 all migrares sight surveys,
, Varying each honr, from change to change propell’d. 8 50
This grows and ripens, and with age corrupts3
That, from its ruins, springs, and perfects life.
So time transmutes the total world's vast frame,
From state to state urg’d on, now void of powers
Erst known, and boasting those unknown before. 8 55
Hence, doubtless‚ earth prodigious forms at first
Gender'd‚ of face and members most grotesque3
Monsters half-man, half-woman, not from each
Bistam, yet neither total; shapes unsound,

Foodess, ancl handless‚ void of mouth or eye, 860
