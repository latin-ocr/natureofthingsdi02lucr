The vine's purpureal spirit? foods mankind
Without may flourish, and, through many a clime,

This moment know not3 but of virtue void,

And purity of heart, man ill can thrive.

Hence ampler far his claim to sites divine

whose dulcet solaces whole nations feel,

Soothing the wounded spirit as they How.

Should'st thou with him .e'en HERCULES compare,

ahed and murder, whatever may be their titles, and
however they may be applaudcd in the flecting hour
” of their prosperity. “ Sapientia enim est una,’' ob-
,eerves Cicero, “ quae maestitiam pellat ex animis,
quae nos exhorrescere metu non sinat, qua prae-
ceptrice in tranquillitate vivi potest, omnium cupidi-
tatum ardore restincto.” De Fin. l. i. ‘⁴ It ia Wisdom
alone that drives uneasiness from the mind, and for·
bide us to be overpowered by terror in any situation.
Guided by thia preceptress, we may live with tranquil-
lity,and extinguish the flame ofeveryinordinatc desire.'’
This is the Wisdom which Lucretius is extolling,
and which Solomon has still more forcibly adjured us to
the love of, in an almost infinite variety of passages, of
which the following, containing an obvious reference
ιο the union of the vine and the elm, is not the least
beautiful. Prov. ἰν. 7, 8 z

tween Epicurus, who, by his precepts and example,
enlightened the mind of man, and freed it from the
tert-ors of ignorance, and superstition, and Cere&
Bacchus, and Hercules, who, by their respective,
and, certainly, laudable exertionS, relieved his cor-
poreal distresses‚ and freed him from the ten-ors of
want, wild beasts‚ and other mischiefs that haunted
the world in their days. The labours of Hercules,
here individually referred to, are too generally known,
both in their sabulous history, and symbolic allusion,
to render any further explanation necessary. Ι shall
take the liberty, however, of inserting the following
passage from the Odyssey‚ in which they are all re-
