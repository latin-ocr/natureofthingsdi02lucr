DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. VI.

Usque adeo fugitant, non iras Palladis aereis,

Pervigilii caussa, Graium ut cecinere poetae;

Sed natura loci opus ecficit ipsa suapte.

In Syria quoque fertur item locus esse, videri,

Quadrupedes quoque quo, simul ac vestigia primum

Intulerint, graviter vis cogat concidere ipsa,

Manibus ut si sint divis mactata, repente.

Omnia quae naturali ratione geruntur3

Et, quibus e fiant caussis, adparet origo:

Janua ne posita hiis Orci regionibus esse

Credatur3 post hinc animas Acheruntis in oras

Ducere forte deos Maneis inferne reamur:

Naribus alipedes ut cervei saepe putantur

Lambinus, that they are either altogether spuriouS,
or ought to be amended thus ;

Qualis apud Cumas locus est montemque vcsevum,

Oppleti calidis ubi fumant fontibus auctus ;
which pretended correction has been hitherto almost
uniformly followed by both editors and translators.
The great objection to it, however, is, that it devi-
atcs most nnpardnnably in the first half of the first
line from all the manuscripts, which unanimously con-
cur, thus far, in using the same terms, and terminate
the line either with montes or montis, occurring thus,
consistently with Salmasius :

Islocus est Cumae apud . . . . montes (or montis.)

and the blank is variously filled up with et visui per,—
acris vapor—ejus suh pede—etruscos sub—mimi per—-
and many other expressions, equally different from
each other.

referring to an Avernus in the province of Syria Pro-
per, but to that entitled Plutonium in Hierapolis, in
the province of Ocelo-Syria, of which Strabo gives a
particular account in lib. xiii. But caverns emitting
azotic vapour are by no means confined to any indi-
vidual country, and may have existed in both these
provinces. The Grotto del’ Cani, in the vicinity of
Naples, has acquired more celebrity than even the
pimenium, and is precisely of the same specics as
this individually selected by Lucretius, as existing in
Syria. Our poet is strictly philosophie in his mode
of accounting for the baneful effects of these extra-
ordinary cavei-ns ; and the same reason will hold,
why brutes, more particularly, were the subjects of
the fatal influence of the Syrian avernum, that is
offered by every natural philosopher of the present
day with regard to a similar effect in the Neapolitan
grette, to wit, that the fixed air, or choke·damp‚ aa
it is generally termed, is so much heavier than atmo-
spheric air, that it seldom rises above a foot or two

above the surface of the earth; whence brutes in
