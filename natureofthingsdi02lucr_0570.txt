Sic igitur per eum possunt erumpere funtem,

DE RERUM NATURA.

Ltn. VI.

Et scatere² illa foras in stuppam semina: quae quom

Conveniunt, aut in teda'i' corpore adhaerent,

Ardescunt facile ex templo; quod multa quoque in se

Semina habent ignis stuppae, tedaeque‚ tenentes.

Nonne vides etiam, nocturna ad lumina linum

Nuper ubi exstinctum admoveas, adcendier ante,

Quam tetigit flammam teclamque pari ratione?

Multaque praeterea, prius ipso tacta vapore

Eminus ardescunt, quarn conminus inbuat ignis.

Hoc igitur fieri quoque in illo funte putandum est.

Quod super est, agere incipiam quo foedere fiat

Naturae, lapis hicc’ ut ferrum ducere possit,

‘The stone tcrm'dMAGNET hythe GREEKS, at·
tracts] There is nothing in nature too re-
condite ἴοι· the dariug penetration of our poetic phi-
losopher. The timid mineralogist of modern days
cannot, without surprize, behold him thus undaunt-
edly endeavouring to develope a bend, into whose
mysterious union he himself feels totally unable to
penetrate ε and if, in pursuing his hardy footsteps‚hc
perceive the bold speculator, at times, bewildered in
a wrong path, he will seldom be able to point out to
him a truer.

Hence, Pelignac, to whose negative declaration,
neither our poet, nor any modern philosopher, will,
probably, object :

Miracula nondum

Omnia magnetis perspeximus ; at mihi certum est

Magnetem non esse animal ; nec amoris ab aestu

Ferratus trahere, ac secum vincire catenas.

Auri-Luca. v. 1156.

For not yet clearly are the wonders trac’d
Prov’d by the magnet ; but to me most clear
Seems it no animal ; nor led by bonds

Of mutual love t’ attract and clasp the steel.

The ferrugineus ore, here spoken of, for it is no-
thing else than ferrugineus ore, with a saturation
of magnetic aura, was denominated, as Lucretius
observes, mag-net, from its having been first noticed
among the MagneteS, or inhabitants of Magnesia, a
region of Lydia. It is also often entitled Hercu-
leus lapis 3 either because it was first traced by Her-
cules, or detected iu the vicinity of Heraclea; or,
lastly, from the prodigious strength of its attrac-
tion. Lucretius, indeed, employs this latter term
on no occasion, but Marchetti has introduced it into
his version, with a view of varying his phraseology ι
