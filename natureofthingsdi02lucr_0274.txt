260 DE RERUM NATURA. Lm. V.

Non ruere avolsos silices a montibus altis;

Nec validas aevi vireis perferre, patique, y 315
Finiti ? neque enim caderent avolsa repente,

Ex infinito quae tempore pertolerassent

Omnia tormenta aetatis, privata fragore.

Denique, jam tuere hoc, circum supraque, quod omne
Continet amplexu terrarum3 procreat ex se ι , 320
Omnia, quod queidam memorant, recipitque perempta:
Totum nativum mortali corpore constat. .

Nam, quodquomque alias ex se res auget, alitque,

Deminui debet 3 recreari quom recipit res.

Praeterea, si nulla fuit genitalis origo 32 5

Terrarum et coeli, semperque aeterna fuere3

honour to any poet, and to any, even the most serious
occasion. The Night Thoughts of Young abeund

W'hat are our noblest ornaments, but deaths

Not man alone—his brealhing lust expires,
