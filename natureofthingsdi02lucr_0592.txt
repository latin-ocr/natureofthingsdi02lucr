ιι, commonly act-ruine& is thus told us in verse, by

our own munti-yman, Dycr:

Tyrian Melan-tm, thus (the first who brought

Tyre's nst-ful ore from Albion’s distant isle,

And, for unwearicd toils and arts, the name

Of Hercules acquir'd)—wlien o'cr the mouth

Of his attendant sheep-dog he beheld

The wonnded murex strike a purple stain,

The purple stain on flcecy woofs hc spread,

Which lur'd the eye, adorning many a nymph,

And drew the pomp of trade to rising Tyre.

This is the common story: but in the frag-
ment of Palaephatus the Egyptian, De Inventione
Purpurae, this Hercules is represented as a philo-
sopher, contemporary with Phoenix king of Tyre,
to whom, instead of employing it publicly as an or-
nament for the fair, he communicated the discovery
confidentinlly, and who restrained thc use of it to his
own pers iii—adopted it, from its unrivalled beauty,

ouh] I have often had occasion to point
ent 3 variety of resemblances between Lucre·
tius and Shakspcare. WNhether these have, or have
not been the effect of mere accident, I will not pre-
tend to decide: if they have, they involve 3 supposi-
tion far more extraordinary than that of previous
knowledge and express imitation. The above is so
pointedly similar to the following well-known pas-
sage in the celebrated speech of Macbeth, after the
murder of Duncan, that the resemblance cannot pos-
sibly be overlooked by any one :

Will all great Neptune’s ocean wash this blood

Clean from my hand ?—No—this my hand will
rather

The multitudinous sea incarnadine.

1 have not, in my own version, given an inten-
tional inclination towards this passage: the original

requires no such aid to maintain its parallelism. It
occurs as follows, ver. 1074 ε

Non, si Neptuni fluctu renovare operam des3
Non, Mare si totum velit eluere omnibus undis.

But whether this be imitation on the part of
Shakspeare‚ or not, there can be little doubt that
the following is so on the part of Seneca:

Violentus unda, Tigris, aut Rhenus ferox,
