Boon IV. THE NATURE OF THINGS. f>

Abash'd, recoils; would fain, in honey'd phrase,

. Tun'd by the muses, to thine ear recite
Its vast concerns3 if hapIy I may hope 20
To fix thine audience, while the flowing verse

Unfolds the nature, and the use of thingS.

Of seeds primordia13 how, in various forms,
Oft differing each from each, at will they roam, 2 5
Urg’d on by ceaseless motion,—prov'd the mode

Since, too, the mind’s deep nature we have trac'd‚
&Vhence first it springs, with body how unites,
And how, when sever'd‚ to primordial seeds 30
Again it lapses 3-—haste we next t’ unfold

Those forms minute, a theme connected close,
