Boon VI. THE NATURE OF THINGS. 443

ConceiveS, dull reas'ner‚ they can all things do,
While yet himself nor knows what may be done, 65
Nor what may never, nature powers defin'd
Stamping on all, and bounds that none can pass:
Hence wide, and wider errs he as he walkS.
These notions if thou chace not, driving far
Thoughts of the gods unworthy, and adverse 70
To the pure peace they cover, thou wilt oft
Foretaste the heavenly vengeance that thou dread’st.
Not that the majesty of powers like these
Rage e’er can violate, or dire revenge
Rouse into action3 but that thou thyself 7 5
Hence thy own ease wilt shipwreck with the storms
Of passions fierce, and foul; nor e'er approach
With hallow’d beart, the temples they possess,

Nor, deeply musing, mark with soul serene

gods of the pcopie, but as the vast concavity or tcm-
