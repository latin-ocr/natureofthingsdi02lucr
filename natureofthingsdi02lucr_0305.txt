Copernicus, the contest between the adherents to
this, and the system of Ptolemy‚ was conducted
with the utmost degree of warmth and acrimony.
The schoolmen who uniformly professcd the latter,
stimulated the church into a common cause with
themselves ς and as they were not able to silence their
adversaries by fair argument, endeavoured to do so
by the more forcible means ofimprisonment and ex-
ile. The Scriptures, it was said, had inculcatcd
their own hypothesis; and to maintain that the sun
rested‚ and the earth moved, was actual blasphemy.
It was denied, however, that the Scriptures had in·
culcated any thing of the kind, or that they were
designed to instruct us in philosophy of any descrip-
tion: the system of Ptolemy, it was superadded,
was erroneous in its first principles, and with all the
alterations it had sustained, and the complex ma-
chinery with which it had been encumbcred, was
still incompetent to account for a variety of the most
common phaenomena; while that of Copernicus, on
the contrary, was simplein its structure, satisfactory
in its solution, and infinitcly more sublime and corn-
prehensive in its compass.

To adjust this dispute, Tycho Eadm, about half
a century afterwards, introduced a third system bor—
rowed from both the former. He retained the earth
in the centre of the starry lirinainent, and supposed it
to be permaneutly fixe-(l in itr. station; while, as on
the Ptolemaic system, the heavens revolved arouud
it in the space of twenty-four hours: but, like Co-
pernicus, he conceived thc sun to be the centre of
the orbits of Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and
Saturn; and that the moon had a distinct and
monthly motion round the earth, as had also the dif-
ferent satellites of Jupiter and Saturn perindie mo—
tions round their respective planeta—This theory,
however, instead of adjustiug the supposed difficulties
or incongruities of the two former, is sar more ein-

barrassed than eitherof thern: and although attempt-:d
to be improved upon by Longomontanus, and several
other astronomerS, has never acquired auyconsiderable
degree of reputation. TheCopernican system hasbeen
progressively advancing over every rival theory from
the first moment of its publication, and the labem-s
of Gallum, Kepler, Des Cartes, Newton, Clau-aut.
Euler, and D'Alzmbert‚ have completed its triumph.

Fields, a very elegant orrery constructtd upon the
Ptolem-dic hypothesis, and which, upon mechanical
principles exhibitcd all the more common phaenome.
