THE NATURE OF THINGS.

The fluid of light, if it actually impinged against
bodies of the most polishcd make, must, in conse-
quence of the harshness and irregularity which, in
spite of all their gloss, they still possess at their sur-
face, very imperfeetly reflect the light which thus
strikes against them, and render the image, which
would be hereby communicated, extremely decep-
tive and inadequate. This, aud several other ob-
jections of equal validity‚ have been long urged
against the Newtonian system : and how is the dif-
ficulty surmonnted? Why, the current of light,
Sir Isaac informs us, never does absolutely im-
pinge against any substance, without being totally
lost and absorbed ; except in the case of transparent
or diaphonous bodies, which it transpierces without
injury ε but that all bodies by which it is refracted
or reflected, so as to give to the eye the picture of the
body mels, by a most extraordinary power, refract
or reflect it before it comes into actual contact.
This, too, is an ingenious solution, but it is nothing
more 3 we have no adequate proof of the fact what-
soever: and it labours under this additional evil,
that isit be difficult to account sor a perfect com-
munication of the image of even the most glossy
and poli-rhed objects to the pupil, it is, at least, as
difficolt ιο conceive, that a column of light can be
acted upon by a substance towards which it is ap-
proaching, and repellcd from it bcs'ore it touches it,
and without the existence of any known or apparent
medium. However ingenious the solution, nothing,
therefore, appears to be gained by it : wc only lose
one objection to be involved in a second os at least
eqnal magnitude. Mairan and Du Tour have, iu—
deed, endeavoured to surmount this additional ob-
jection; aud what is the explanation they advnnec?
'i'hut :ill substance-s· h ,νι- an atmosphere of n certain
density and extent thrown soith around them, coin-
posed ol* the finer particlcs of their own constituent
substan-:m and thnt this becomes the medium by
which they reptl the advancing column of light, and

communicate the image of the parent object before
it absolutely reaches the object itself. But what
precs, I inquire, have we of such an existence?
and if‘it be admitted, do we not admit, at the same
time, the very first principle of the Epicurean the-
ory of optics which merely contends for the truth
of such an atmosphere, which, it assertis, is pro-
pellecl to a greater distance than is wished for by the
French philosoph-ers, and produces the image by
such propulsion alone?

l do not enumerate these objections to overthrow
the Newtonian theory—that is totally out os my
power—but only to evince, that if the Epicurean
hypothesis be so loaded with difficulties as to compe!
us to reject it, we have, neverdoeless, not exchanged
it for a system that is altogether impeccable.

The general principles of the Newtonian hypothe-
sis are, nevertheless, fixed upon the most impregna-
blc basis; and are the result of facts and experi-
ments equally clear and incontrovertible. Yet, in
pointing out the errors of the prior system of Epi-
σαι-υς, it is but sair to give a glanee at the difficulties
which still attach to this justly boasted discovery of
modern times. These difficulties and defects have
long, indeed, been noticed by philosophers of the
first reputation and ability; and Mnlbranch, Huy-
gens, Emer, and the Bernouillis, have strenuonsly
attempted to establish others upon its destruction.
But objectionable as it is, the various hypotheses
they' have offered in its stead have been justly
deemed more objectionable still ς and the Newtonian
theory ia yet prvdominant, and, perhaps, ever will
bc so in the republic of letters.

Ver. 223. (lslhings dsfin'ael born maselan] All the
common editions of Lucretius have a most intuleinble
and absurd reading of the verse of which this is in-
tanded for the translation. ln connexion with the
two preceding. they make it run thus:
