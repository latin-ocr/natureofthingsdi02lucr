THE NATURE OF THINGS.

m
Lo
p.-

While yet himself nor knows what may* be done

Nor what may never; nature powers defin'd

Stamping on all, and bouncls that none can pass.

First‚ to delay no more then, we maintain

That earth, air, ocean, these stupendous scenes‚

These triple bodies so cliversely rear’d,

These, MEMMqu ! these one common day shall doom

To utter ruin3 when, for ages propt,

100

The world’s vast system shall itself dissolve.

Nor hid from me how new the creed we teach,

How wond'rous to the mind, that heaven and earth

should perish ever ; or how hard the rask

By words alone such tenets to confirm.

105

For thus thou e'er wilt find it when thy tongue

Opes some fresh subject sight has ne'er survey'd,

was an idea derogatory to the divinity from whom
it sprang, to conceive that the beauteous machine
would ever suffer dissolution. Aristode, on the con—
trary, while he equally maintained the world’s im-
mortality, seems to have conceived that its immorta-
lity depended upon its eternity of form as well as of
substance3 that, :ts it never had a beginning, so it
never can have an ending: in which belief he was
countcnaneed by ocellus Lucanus, Xenophanes, Par-
menides, and many others of the earlier sagos of
Gra-ece. The doctrine of Epicurus, conccrning the
dissolutioni of the world. was derived from the school
of Leucippus and Democritus, from whose atomio
ereed, ns 1 have often obsti-ved already, he took
many ofthe most important articles ofhia own hypo-
thesis. lt was also accreditcd by Empedocles, Hc-
nclitum Anaximander, Anaxagoras, the Egyptians,

and Hindus. But, as I have before remaikcd, it
was not the popular belief, nor the belief of the most
popular philosophum, when Lucretius first started it
among his own coifntrymcn. aud it required some dc-
grce of pre-face, therefore, as wcll as of courugc, ῑο
become its open and avowed advocate.
