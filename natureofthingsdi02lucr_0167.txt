’ Boox IV. THE NATURE OF THINGS. 153

Oft to the centre of the sacred groves
At midnight hurry, in their dreams disturb'd
By hideous sight of hawks‚ on outstretch'd wing,
Prowling aloft all actixie for the pounce.
Then what vast toils engage men when asleepl 10 30
How pants the mind beneath superb exploits!
Kings strive with kings in combat3 or at large
Contend‚ surrender, pour the eries of death3
While some fight on, though wounded‚ loading still
All heaven with groanS‚ as though to atoms torn 103 5
By some huge lion, or remorseless pard. ⁰
Some, too, aloud their machinations tell,
And thus in sleep full oft themselves accuse.
Some on their death-bed seem3 and some to leap
Headlong from precipice33 by the fright ¹040
Awol<e‚ of reason so bereft, the mind
Scarce with the day resumes its wonted reign.
While, oft, the dreamer, all athirst, o'erhangs

Some joyous stream, and drinks the total tide.

Ourselvcs create them. For, at ease rccli¹1¹d2 In like manner, Juvenal, addressing himself ‹ejusne--
R'hcn sleep o'crsways, and spons th‘ unauxious personifigdg
