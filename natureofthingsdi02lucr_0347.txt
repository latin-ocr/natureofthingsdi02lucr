of these birds first, of wing and plume diverse,

Egypt, from whom the doctrine was, perhaps, origi-
nally derived, uniformly concur in the belief that
birds were created anterior to all other animals. Ac-
cording to Anaximander, and several other philoso-
pheru, whose opinions are recited by Diodorus Sicu-
lus, lib. i. and who are also supposed to have ac-
quired their knowledge from Egypt, these, in com-
mon with all others, except fishcs, were hatched in
little genial membranes or wombs, similar to the
filins which we trace, even at present, in stagnant fens
and marshes, when, after a continuante of cold wea-
ther, the air suddenly becomes hot and sultry. But
Lucretius does not deviate from their accustomed
economy; he derives them from eggs, variaeque vo-
lucres, ova relinquebant: and if Ι understand his sys-
tem might, he conceived that as soon as the sum-
mits of the lostiest mountains became desiccated by
atmospheric exhalatiom and the retreat of the chao-
tic ocean, these primitive cggs, formed, perhaps, by

filmy cysts, or bubbles of exhaling vapour, impregna-
ted by the etherial spirit that ascended, and dnly
heated by the extricated caloric that accompanied it,
were deposited upon them ς and in process of time
were burst by the calluw brood, sor whom the geni-il
earth had already provided a luxuriant harvest osve—
getable nutrition. This formation of thc parent
stock of birds by eggs, rather than by any uther mc-
dium, has been copied by our own immortal Milton ;
