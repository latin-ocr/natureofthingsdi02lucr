Nequidquam3 quoniam medio de fonte leporum

Surgit amari aliquid, quod in ipsis floribus angat:

Aut quom conscius ipse animus se forte remordet,

In wild disorder, and unfit for use,
Their points obtuse, and seathers drunk with wine.
Tnsx, B. 11.

But the metaphor here adopted is more audaciously
employed by the German pects, than by those of any
other nation with which 1 arn acquainted. Thus
Klopstock, in his Messias:

Sieht er den gottlichen kommen, so geht en von
seligkeit {ruakerij
Ihm entgegen. Ges. iii.
The godlike man forth—coming he descries,
And, drunk wilh heliam, to meet him flies.

And, again, in one of his most beautiful odes, en-
titled Die Beiden Musen (The two Muses) ι

sehon hub sich der herold
Ihr die drommet und ihr trunkm blick schwamm.

The herald uprose, blew his trumpet before her,
Her drunken eyes swam.

Here, too, the sacred writings furnish us with a

parallel metaphor, and used with an equal degree of
energy :

My arrows will 1 make drunk with blood,
And my swerd shall bouquet upon stesh ,-
With the blood of the slain aud the captive,
With the utmost vengeance of an enemy.
Dsur. xxxii. 42.

Ver. 1 167. Now flamus in ribhands‚ in tiaras flames
Ful! o'er huf-one, ]In the original, thus :

 

Et bene parta patrum fiunt anademata‚ mitrae.

Ver. 1122.

The anadema (ab αναδεω, redimire) was an orna-
mental bandeau of ribbands, elegantly interwoven
with the hair of the head, such as is not unfrequently
met with in the present day among our fashionable
fair. Marchetti has translated the term by the phrase
fasee di ghirlande, “ wreaths ofgarlands ;'' which,how-
ever, does not exactly correspond to the anadema of
the Greek and Roman ladies. It sometimes also
means the graceful bow os ribbands, or golden chains,
with which the mitre or tiara was tied under the chin 5
the mitre itself being a coronet or turban cap, adapted
to the upper part of the head, and splendidly deco-
x-ated with emer'alds and pearls, of the former of
which our attentive author has already taken notice.
A dress, not widely varying from this was some·
times affected‚even by young men who were notorious
for their voluptuousness and effeminacy. Thus vir-
gil 2 ’

Et nune ille Paris cum semiviro comitatu,

'Moeonia mentum mitra* cn'nemque madentem

§ubnexuffi rapto potitur. ΖΕΝ. iv. 215.

And still this Paris, with tiara tied
His chin beneath, and liquid locks, enjoys,
Mid throngs effeminate, his theft of love.

With respect to the anadcma, there are several of
our earlier English poets who understand it in the

sense attributed to it by the Florentine translator.
