THE NATURE OF TIIINGS.

among civilized mitioris, with all the polish and ex-
perience we possess in the present day, we do not
know the full scope and power of all our externa! or-
gans. There is a vast variety of musclcs bestowed
upon us which, from want of use alone, are become
totally incapable of exertion‚ and all the energies of
which we only know from the few who occasionally
put them to the test. The toes, it may be said»
were not given us to write with, nor the hands to
walk upon : but the fact is, that both were given us
to make the best possible improvement of: and wc
well know, from persons defective in their limbs,
that the toes may be inured to writing as well as the
fingers3 and that the hands and arms may become
very ensential instrumenta in the action of walking,
where the feet are imperfect or wanting. “ Of the
different members or parts of the body‚'' observes
Cicero, “ some seem to be given us by nature for
use, as the hands, the legs, and the fect ; and as to
our internal organa, let physicians inform us of their
vast importance. There are other members, how-
ever,'' continues he, “ that appear of no real uti-
lity, and as though formed for ornament alone ς such
is the tail to the peacock, the many-coloured feathers
to the pigeon, and the nipples, and the heard to mcn.’¹
Dc Fin. lib. iii. It is probable, however, that
every animal appendage, aa well as organ, is designed
for some intrinsic use, although we have not yet
learnt the use for which it was intended. Of what
ornament to the male sex can we rcckon the benrd,
from which wc arc daily endeavouring to free our-
selves as an inconvenience and a distigurement? οι·
the nipplcs, which all natione, who have cnicxged
stom a *nv-age life, have uniformly concealcd by dra.

pery? and as to many of the inter-nal organs of the
body, the appeal to physicians is in vain, even in
the present day. We know, perhaps, the use of
the greater number, but by no means of all. We
have learnt much concerning the office of the bmin ς
and we certainly, in this country, know the use of
the stomacb still better: but of the use of tho
spleen, the pancreas, or even the liver, we are, to
the present moment, totally ignorant. That they
were created for appropriate uses, it would be absurd
to deny; but they do not indicate those uses to us.
The fact is, with respect to ourselves, as well as with
respect to every thing else, the means are put into
our possession, but we must exert ourselves to find
out the endu or, in the language of our poet that

immediately follows z

nought so knows its office as to act
WVhen first produc'd, but all produc’d, alone
Learns it progressive.

 

The translatore, throughout the whole passage,
having been uniformly misled by the earlier scholiasts,
