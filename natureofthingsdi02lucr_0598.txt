Atthide tentantur gressu5‚ oculeique in Achaeis

Finibus: inde aliis alius locus est inimicus

Partibus, ac membris; varius concinnat id ae'r.

Proinde, ubi se coelum, quod nobis forte venenum,

Conmovet, atque ae'r inimicus serpere coepit;

Ut nebula ac nubes, paullatim repit, et omne,

Qua graditur, conturbat, et inmutare coactat.

Fit quoque, ut in nostrum quom venit denique coelum,

Conrumpat‚ reddatque sui simile, atque alienum.

Haec igitur subito clades nova, pestilitasque,

Aut in aquas cadit, aut fruges persidit in ipsas,

Aut alios hominum pastUS‚ pecudumque cibatus3

des, or leprosy, had its origin in the region here re-
ferred to. Galen, indeed, appears to confine it al-
together to this country, ad Glauc. lib. xiii. Celsus
declares, that it was scarcely known in Italy in his
aera, lib. iii. 24. and Pliny informs us of the truly
sanguinary remedy adopted by the Egyptian mo-
narchs‚ when, nnlnckily for their subjecte, they la-
bonrcd beneath this malady. Nat. Hist. xix. 16.
“ AEgypti, peculiare hoc malum, et curn in reges in·
cidissct populis funebre ; quippe in balneis solia tem-
perabantur humano sangnine ad medicinam eam.''
‘¹ This disordcr is pactiliar to Egypt, and when it af-

are on such occasions warmed with human blood by

Also naht die pest in mittern’aehtlicher stunde

Schlummernden st'adten. Es liegt auf ihren ver-
breiteten fliigeln

An dem mauren der tod, und haucht verderbcnde
dunste. Mess. Gss. iii.

So towards the wearied city, as it sleeps,

In dead of night the pest malignam creeps ,-
Death marks the vapour with triumphant wings,
And o'er its walls the floating misehief flings.

In Virgil’s description of the pest that affected
brutes alone, it is impossible not to perceive that he
has borrowed much from our own poet ε yet is there
something wondenfully sublime and energetic in re-
presenting the flend Tisiphone as rising from hell,
and driving before her a train of diseases and fears ς
and, as Dr. Warton observes, it cannot but remind
ns of that exalted image in Habakkuk‚ iii. 5. where
the prophet, speaking of the Almighty‚ says,—“ be-
fore him went the Pssrmncnss’

The personification of Death, in the act of exe-
cuxing the divine commands, is exhibited, with great
