THE NATURE OF THINGS. 549<

Down, like a weighr, he tumbles through the void,

And from each pore his airy soul exhales.

In wells profound the gurgling lympth that spring&

863

Springs chilliest in the summer 2——for all earth

Expands beneath the sun-beams, and emits

The seeds of fire far prompter to the day:

Whence more⁴ her surface burns with heat evolv'd‚

And colder fiows the fountain deep-conceal'd.

870

While, mid the wintry frosts, her frame contracts,

Condenses closer, and, condensing, strains

The fiery atoms into caves and wells.

A fount, 'tis rumour'd, near the temple purls.

Of JovE AMMonN, tepid through the night,

And cold at moon-day: and th' astounded sago

rain was, probably, like the Jewish, a hot spring,
with a tide recurring once in every twenty-four hours—
with this only different-e, that the tide of the latter
returned about noon, and that of the former at sun-
εει, or midnight.—-—Our own country has a great num-
ber of these extraordinary springs, but they are in ge-
neral so well eupplied with subterrancan beat as to
suffer no intermission whatever. The chdcn-well
in the celebrated peak of Dtrbyshirc, has an un-
doubted flux and reflux os its waters. but its tide is
irregular; and it is not supplied with hcat from be-
low. The most extraordinary hut .·prings with which
we are acquainted‚ arc those at chser and Rerknm,
both in Iceland. Their hears return with their tides,
but these tides, though irregular in their periods, rc-
cur so frequently as to prevent thcir watcrs from
ever becoming cold. That of the former returns ten
or twelve times in the course os the day. and such is
its extreme calidity and consequent ebullition dut-ing

 

these recurrences, that its watcrs arc projected in a
jet-d'cnu‚ of not less than from five to ten fathoms of
perpendicularhcight. Thetidcs of the hot-springs at
Rcikum, sor there τιτι· several, arc rtncwcd sull mure
