DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. v1.

Nubibus exstructis: nam coelo nulla sereno,

Nec leviter densis mittuntur nubibus umquam.

Nam (lubio procul hoc fieri manifesta docet res3

Quod tunc per totum concrescunt ae'ra nubes

Undique, utei tenebras omneis Acherunta reamur

Liquisse‚ et magnas coeli complesse cavernas:

Usque adeo, tetra nimborum nocte coorta,

Impendent atrce Formidinis ora superne,

Quom conmoliri tempestas fulmina coeptat.

Praeterea, persaepe niger quoque per mare nimbus,

Ut picis e coelo demissum fiumen, in undas

Sic cadit, et fertur tenebris procul ; et trahit atram,

Fulminibus gravidam, tempestatem, atque procellis;

Ver. 2 56. Blackem throughout, hemath the clustering
crowd] This, and the three ensuing verses,

are repeated from Book IV. 1743 and with admira-
ble force and propriety adapted to the present de-
scription. Lucretius was no vulgar observet of natu-
ral events: he saw every thing with the eye of sci-
euce‚ as well as felt every thing with the sensibility
of a poet: no lineament was too minute to escape
the curiosity of his attention : and his account in this

place of the rise and progress of the thundei·-storm‚
is so parallel with the history of it, as narrated by
Beccaria, that I shall endeavour to exhibit the ob-
servations of the Italian philosopher in as few words
as possible fur a compar-iou. The thunder-storm, says
the latter, is introduced by the appearance osone or
more dense clouds, in a calm and quiet atmosphere,
,vigmenting rapidly in εἷκε from its attracting to it-
self, where it proceeds from a single cloud, the smal-
lcr :uid light-r, or adscititious clondlets in its vi-
ciniity, till the whole coalesces, and becomes one
iai-{form nanS, pilei} cloud over cloud with homo-

geneous arches above, but fringed and ragged, and

dreadfully black on its lower surface; consider-
able portioris being apparently detached towards the

earth, yet without quitting their connexion with the
main body. Though in some cases, instead of these
friiiged and detached fragments pointing downwards,
the whole of the lower sursace seems to swell into dis·
tinct, but vast protuberances, each still bending to-
wards ilie earth, and occasionally nearly touching its
bosom. When the original thunder-cloud has thus
acquired a sufficient augrrentation both in depth and
breadtb, the matter of the lightning it contains
strikes between itself and the earth in two opposite
directions, the path of the corruscation strctching
th iiiiii gli the whole substance of the cloud aud its ad-
scititious branches. From the agitation thus produced
amidst the latter, the imprisoned rain generally de-
scend> in great abundance, and if the agitation be
very vitlem, it is often accompanied with a fall of
hail. The longer the lightning continues, the rarer
and lighter in colour the cloud gradually becomes3
