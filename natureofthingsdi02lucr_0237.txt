THE NATURE OF THINGS.

“ Boou V. 223

Fam’d for exploits, from reason far thou err’st. 2 5
For what were now to us, with all their threats,

NEMAEA'S lion, or th' ARCADIAN boar?

The bull of CRETE, or hydra-headed snake

That rear⁷d, o'er LERNA'S banks, his dreadful fangs?

Or what to us the triple—breasted strength 30
Of three-fac'd GERYON, 01· the horses wild

Of onMED, o'er ISMARA, and THRACE‚

And all B15TON1A‚ snorting ceaseless fire?

pagated almost as extensively. The existence of
both, as objects of religious adamica, seems to
have been contemporaneous in Crete, Lybia, and
Italy : and while in Hindu the former was acknow-
ledged under the dcnomination of'Brahma‚ “the
father of gods and men ;” the latter was worshipped
as ‘⁴ the glory of heroes‚” under the title of Sandes,
Sanes, Desanes, Dorsanes; probably from the Ba-
bylonian Sas, or Saos, which was again confounded
with the generic appellation Belus. The origin of
Sas and Saos is problematical. Mr. Allwood ha-
zardsa conjecture, from the existence of the Oriental
prefix Za or Sa, that some such expression as th'is
'actually existed, as an inda-pendant term, in far dis-
tant ages, both in Egypt and Babylonia; and that
these were compounded with some other simple term,
aa As or Es, in order to compiete an epithet,
whence the compounds Sas, Saos, or Zas, Zam,
which were applied to Bacchus, Jupiter, or what-
ever other deity was regarded as supreme and nn-
rivalled. The Ethiopians have still a mdical not dis-
similar, Η ΛΚ sb (Zahh), the original import of
which is now lost, bnt it ic· retained in its duplicated
form Ἡ HN Η Q, and implius, literally, exun-
dation, or an overflow of waur, and, in its mcta-
phorical sense, an cxcess or superabnmlancc of any
thing else. It occurs in the Ethiopic version of the
New Testament, Lnke vi. 38. and corrczponds with
‘hc Greek dxrpugxrpncv.

From the same origin, he deduces Ξπ, the sur»,
or fountain of light, and Σεα, a title sor Hecate οι
Diana. And hence, from the well-known conver-2105:
of the different mdical systems of idolatry into each
other, the same species of term may bave been oc-
casionally applied to any of the denies who were oi i·-
ginaily worshipped as types of the ask, the sun, οῖ
the serpent. Σεει, it might be added, was the Greek
term for corn: an appropriation of the term not dis-
ficult to be accounted for upon this principle: for
Σεοι was Diana, Diana was Venus, Venus was Ceres ;
or, rather, all these deities were alike worshipped
under the gent-ric term, Βε-πιῑηοτ-Δκμκτηρ, or Dc-
mcter. See this commutabiiity more fully illustrate-d
in Note on Book IV. v. 1214.
