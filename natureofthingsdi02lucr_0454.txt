DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm VI.

Ventorum excierat pacator, et omnia rursum,

Quae furerent, sunt placato convorsa favore.

Caetera, quae fieri in terris coeloque tuentur

Mortales, pavidis quom pendent mentibus, saepe,

50

Et faciunt animos humileis formidine divom,

Depressosque premunt ad terram; propterea quod

Ignorantia caussarum conferre deorum

Cogit ad inperium res, et concedere regnum;

Quorum operum caussas nulla ratione videre

>55

Possunt, ac fieri divino numine rentur.

Nam, bene quei didicere deos securum agere aevom,

Si tamen interea mirantur, qua ratione

Quaeque geri possint, praesertim rebus in illis,

Quae supra caput aetheriis cernuntur in oris,

60

Rursus in antiquas referuntur religiones,

Faber retains the vulgar lection, but, nevertheless,
admits that the manuscripts for vincendi exhibit ven-
tarum, as proposed by Vossius, and for cursu, rursum.
Lambinus, however, notwithstanding these varia-
tions, was so extremely dissatisfied with the whole
triplet, as to condemn it as supposititious: and
Creech, although he has preserved the common
reading in his Latin edition, has suppressed the en-
tire passage in his English version.

Not so Mr. Wakefield: with uneonquerable pa-
tience he has followed Vossius in his endeavour to
assimilate, as far as possible, the trifling variations‚
which are mostly litei-al, as they occur in the manu-
script copies ; and, by a happy conjecture, that sue-
rant was originally furerent, he has completely, if Ῑ
mistake not, succeeded in restoring the genuine lec-
tion of the original text, and thus confer-red a weigli-

ty obligation on the tribe of classical critics. With
the text thus regenerated, it reads as follows, in the
two last verses, the former remaining unalteredz

Ventorum excierat pacator, e! omm‘a rursum,
Qae furerent, sunt placato convorsa favore.

The rcader will find. that Ι have translated from
the passage thus resuscitated‚ and, with Vossius and
Wakefield, by currum have understood navem. In
Guernier, Marchetti, and all the other versions with
which I arn acquainted, in which this triplet has
been translated at all, currum has been understood li-
terally for a land-chariat, and not metaphorically for
a ship. This use of it, however, by Lucretius, is
confirmed by the following verse of Catullus:

Ipsa levi fecit volitantem flamine currum. lxiv. 9.

To the light gale the flying car she bends.
