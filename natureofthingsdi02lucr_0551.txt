THE NATURE OF THINGS.

537

Yet not restrain’d‚ as GRECIAN poets sing,

By wrath of PALLAs o’er the tell-tale spy·

Profusely lavish'd, but the place alone.

Such place in Syma, too, as fame reports‚

785

The trav’ller traces, o'er whose dire domains

The brute that treads drops instant, as though fell’d

In prompt oblation to th’ infernal powers.

These all subsist from Nature’s gen'ral laws,

And whence their source their earliest rise unfolds;

790

Lest we should judge them the first gates of hell,

And through such portals deem th' infernal gods

Draw the pale spirit to the shades below3

As, with their breath‚ the foot-wing'd deer, 'tis said,

general, and especially those of the more diminutive
clauses cannot avoid brcathing the projected effluvium,
and must necessarily be destroyed. That this is the
immediate cause of their destruction is well known,
because men, and other animals whose lungs have ac-
cidentally imbibed the poisoned air, have been suss'o-
cated in the same manner. Azotic gaas, confine-d by
its specific weight to the bottom of mines or beer
casks, producesa choke-damp of a similar descrip-
tion ς and hence, auch vessels or caverna, may be re-
garded as so many temporary or factitious averni.
