Tempore eo si odorata est, quo menstrua solvit.

Multaque praeterea languentia membra per artus

Solvunt‚ atque animam labefactant sedibus intus.

Denique, si calidis etiam contere lavabris

Plenior, et fueris solio ferventis aqua'l' 3

Quam facile iu medio fit utel des saepe ruinas?

Carbonumque gravis vis, atque odor, insinuatur

Quam facile in cerebrum, nisi aquam praecepimus ante?

At, quom membra domus percepit fervida, nervis

altogether omitted by Creecli. The constitutions

of different personS‚ as 1 have just observed, are very
differently affected by different odours and effluvia.
The smell of cheese, the smell of paisnips, as well as
of many other aculem, will occasionally produce
the effect here spoken of: but the odours of cis-et,
castor, musk, and other antispasmodics of the same
class,are generally far more power-ful in their operation.
‘⁶ I have found‚” observes M. virey‚ in his treatise
on the Exhalations of living Affirnals, “ that this per-
fume (musk), when triturated with liver of sulphur,
became very powerful ; insomnem that it was not ex-
traordinary to see women, and particularly those who
were hysterical and nervous,faint away at its smell, in
the same manner as that of civet occasionally pro-
ducesasimilar effect. The smell of musk has been
known to produce a haernorrhage in a man. The
perfume of the musk ox (Bos Moschatus) is pungent
in proportion to the heat of the climate it inhabits3
hence, the best rnuak is brought from Tonquin, and
the worst from Siberia, or other frigid countries, the

perfume of which is so much decreased as to ap—
proach that of castor.”

Probably, as ΜΓ. Wakefield observes, with his eye

directed towards Homer ι

Now from the walls the clamours reach her eam

And all her members shake with sudden sear:
Forth from her ivory hands the distaff drops.

From which passage, doubtlcss, Virgil ε

 

subitus miserae calor ossa reliquit:
Excussi manibus radii, revolutaque pensa.

An icy cold benumbs her limbs ; she shake33
Her cheeks the blood, her hands the w'eb forsakes.

In the Gondibert of D'Avenant‚ there is a de·
seription somewhat similar, and peculiarly tendet· and
pleasing, though sfiffwed, according to the cuntem
of the day, with a recondite and scientific meta·
phor: it refers to the sair Rhodalind :

Yet sadly is it sung that she, in chade,

Mildly as mourning doves love’s sorrows felt 3
ushan, in her secret tear-s, herfreshness fades,

As roses silently in lymbecks melt. Can-r. i.
