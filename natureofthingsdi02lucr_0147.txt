Now by what means soft SLEEP bedews the limbz,

And from the mind drives every carking care,

five pounds each quintal avcrdupois, is equal to the
enormous sum of twelve hundred and fifty pounds
for every rock. These falling upon this wonderful ma-
chine, broke its supportS, dividcd its gallies, and bat-
tered the whole sambuca to pieces. At the same time,
of the single gallies that attended ou the expedition,
many were totally destroyed, or completely disabled
by assaults from other balistae, while others, again,
unexpectedly clasped hold of by prodigious crows
with iron claws, fastened to a long chain, directed by
vei-y ponderous levers, were either turned dii-cctly
topsy—turvy, whirled into the air, and again dashed
down so forcibly as to bnlge without redres‘, or were
rapidly draggcd towards the shore, and broken to
pieces against the points of the rocks which pro-
jected under the walls. Of these stupendous engines,
notwithstanding many valuable improvements in the
science of mechanics‚ we have no possible concep-
tion ε and the modern engineer, however practically
acquainted with the force of gunpowder, must still
contemplate their effects with astonishment. See Note
on Book VI. v. 333.

On account of oui· more correct ascertainmtnt of
the figure of the earth, and the greater extent of our
voyages, the science of navigatiun is certainly better
understood at present than in any prior period. Na-
vigation, nevertheless, and particularly that branch
of it which extends to the construction of ships, was
by no means neglected among the ancients ; and
M. Le Rui, whose judgmcnt upon this subject will
be disputed by no one, has written an express disser-
tation, introduced into the Memoirs os the National
institute (l’ An. 4. Literat. et Effluit-Arta, tom. Ι.)
to prove that we might still obtain many advantages
by imitating‚ to a greater extent, the vessels os the
Roman republic. This dissertation is to consist of
three distinct memoiru, of which the first only has
hitherto becn presented to the public. In this first
memoir, th«.- celebrated author has clearly ascertained,
that the corvuS, or crow os Duillius, an instrument
like that of Archimedes, bnt os considerably less
power, designcd for thc purpose of grappling with
an antagonist ship, and of affording at the name time

a kind of bridge or gallery into her, by which she
may readily be boarded, might be succcssfuliy em-
ployed against corsairs, and similar pirates. In the
second memoir‚ he proposes to demonstrate, thatin
more nearly assimilating some of our vessels to the
form, the proportion, and the tackle of those os the
arielem, and in allotting them the general qualities
of the trading-vessels of the time of Diodorus Sicu-
lus, our coasting navigation, and, consequently‚ our
commercial ports, would be larg-<ly benefited. In
his third paper, he designs to prove, that the gallies
of tbe second class employed by the ancients in their
naval armaments, and especially that description of
vessels in common use in India till the commencement
of the fifteenth century, exhibited a kind of type of
the AEligenccs made usc of at Havre, and may be em-
ployed in a manner highly beneficial and lucrative for
the commerce and supply of Paris.

To these advantages might have been added an-
other, far more general, and infinitely ruore important
than all the rest—an advantage which seems to have
afforded all the utility of copper-sheathing‚ without
incurring a hundreth part of its weight or expence—
Ι mean the mode of encaustic painfing, invented for
the express purpose of preserving the timber of ships,
and which Pliny informs us so completely succeedffl,
that it was equally proof against the sun, the sea-
water, and the winds. “ Qae pictura‚” says he,
xi. 41. “in navibus, nec sole, nec sale, ventisque
corrumpitnr.” This important invention, unfortu-
natcly for the commercia} world, is completely lost ;
and we possess but little hope of recovering it. lt
consisted, according to the same author, in the nse
os wax, dissolvcd over a sire, and applied by a brnsh t
the plan thus sar described, is extremely simple, bnt
though Pliny says nothing further, this could not be
the whole of it—t‘or he expressly declares it to have
been nn encaustic mode. “ Hoc tertium adcessis'
(says he) (viz. genus incanui) ·‘ resolutis igni ceris
penicillo utendi.‘' But the mode thus discribed can
in nowisc be considered as eucaristie, or burm in ς aud
it is probablc, there-sore, that, superadde-d to thc ac-
count thus pre-..entcd to us, the exterior u'ood-nork
