Boox IV.

Each sep‘rate image viewless strikes the sight,

THE NATURE OF THINGS.

The parent form springs obvious. When severe
Blows the fresh breeze, each particle of wind,
Of bitter cold the sense can ne'er discern,

But the full body rather t then the frasne

Shrinks as though blows from some exterior foe

Were plied perpetual, every nerve assnil’d.

When, too, the finger o'er the polish’d spat

Lets fall its weight, it toucl-ies then alone

The crystal hues, and sufface ;⁴ yet nor hues

Nor surface feels it, but the hardness sole

Its total body boasts, compact and firm.

Now next unfold we* whence the semblence seen

In the clear mirror, far beyond recedes,

Or so pretends, deceptive.

flecting body, and thie frequently in the very name
path orline of incidence, should be able io pass either
by οι· through each other without injury. But the dif-
ficulty, as 1 have already observed, is by no means al-
together removed by the Newtonian theory. Here the
reflected image, from a upeeulumor polished body,
is communicatu} to the organ of vision by a re-
pulsion of the tayo os light which first couveyed
it to the npeculum, in a direct line from the object
it represents. In this case, therefore, there must
be precisely the same opponition of path, and con-
oequently of contest, between the tide οἵ rays re-
turning from the speculum, and· thone advancing
towards it ς and it is not much more easy to conceive
how auch an opposition and contest can occur be-
tween antagoniu. pericii· of light, than antagonist

Sleights like these ‘

pellicles of bodies, without a destruction of the
image they convey.

Lucretius commences with a few problems on the
plane miri-or, or, as it is commonly denominatcd, the
looking-glass; and he here accounts, in tei-ms too cleat-
to require a pai-aphram, sor the image osa radiant point
appearingjuat sofar behind it as the object or radiant
point in itself before it. lt would occupy too much
space to enter into a full comparison of the solution of
all the different and curicus pha-nomena that follow, u
advanced by our poet, and the common system of mo—
dern optics. The grand canon by which the latter re-
solves the problem here exhibitum* well atmnny others
connected with it, is, that ⁸⁴ in a plane inirror every
point of an object is seen in the intersection of the
cathetus of incidente with the reflectes} ny.'’
