Boox VI. THE NATURE OF THINGS. 503

Water and cloud, and all that cloud contains,
As with its frame augments the vital blood,
Or aught besides of moisture through the limbs.
Then, too, the cloudy floscules, as they Hy
O'er the broad main, the briny dew imbibe, 520
As pendant fleeces from the new-shorn flock.
While from each stream, alike, their spongy webs
Drink the light moisture3 which, when once comprest‚
Atom with atoni, in innum'rous modes,
Innum'rous masses, the redundant clouds, 525
Prest by the winds, strive doubly to discharge ι
For, while such pressure bursts them, their own weighr‚
Cloud throng'd o’er cloud, compels the falling shower.
Then, too, abraded by the winnowing winds,
Or by the sun relax'd‚ the cloudy film 530
Pours down its moisture‚ as the strainer thick
Of woof rcdoubled‚ near the solvent firc,

Drops o'er the vase its juices clear—refin'd.
