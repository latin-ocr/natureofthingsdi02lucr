system of religion and philosophy from the Nile to
the Ganges, about a thousand years before Christ.”

Nothing can be more obvious than that the zo·
diacal circle proceeded from one common point, since
not only the same circle is made nse of, and with
very little diversity‚ by all these various, remote, and
unconnected nativus, but since the same na'nes and
ligures are, for the most part, applied to the same
constellations by all of them ς a fact which no com-
bination of chauces, or any moral cause whatever,
independently of that now assigned, cou¹2d have pro-
duced. And that this important circle must have
been contrived and arranged in a very high period of
antiquity is indisputable, from the zodiacs lately dis-
covered in the· two temples at Tentyra and Esne in
Egypt ; and, more especially, from express refertnces
to the zodiacal asterisms in the works of the Indian
poeta, Arnarsinh anti Calidas, who are known, from
thc most positive historic testimony to have preceded
the birth of our Saviour by nearly, if not more than
a ccntury. and were perhaps contemporary with our
own poet.

The introduction of the Hands into the sign Leo,
in t'ne zodiac at Tentyra, has of late been brought
forn-artis, with most beart-felt triumph, by various
infida-l philosophers, to prove that this zodiac must
have been invented at leastsiyi‘ccfz lhorssandlwo hundred
years attrei-ior to the Christian vcra, and, consequendy,
that the Mosaic chronology is fals-c, and its history
all a surgery. Now it is only necessary to silence
this vain-glorieris calculation to obserre, that the

695

hands in Leo did not, among the Egyptians, con·
stitute a symbol of the summer solstice, but was an
apt and beautiful emblem of the cory'uncu'on of the
heliacal rising of Sirius, or the dog-star, which
coincided with the entrance of the sun into the sign
Leo, and the inundation of the Nile. The proof of
this conjunction, and application of the symbol of
the hands, is collected from an express passage in
Horapollo, and is confirmed-by various Egyptian
monuments in which the sign Leo makes-its appear-
ance. We are acquainted‚ moreover‚ with the Egyp-
tian cycle of the dog-star of 1461 years, and know
that its invention took place something less than
135 years before Christ. Indepeniently of which,
it should not escape our attention. that the orna.
ments of the temple at Tentyra are mosily Grecian, “
and that it is decorated with Greek inscriptions:
whence we may fairly collect, that the temple itself
must have been erected after the Macedonian con-
quest, and the subsequent union of the Grecian and
Egyptian orders of architecture. After these ob-
servations² the antiquity of the temple at Esne is not
worth minute-ly inquiring into, since it is allowed
on all sides to be of considerably later date than
that at Tentyra, and is probably not more than
co'e'val with the reign of Angustus.
Domenico Testa, in his very learned and valuable
defence of revelation against this impudent at-
tack of the present day. has, neven-thalem, fallen
into an error in asserting that the constellation of
the Balance, which appears in the two Egyptian
zodiacs, was only discovered by the astronomers of
the school of Alexandria: for the Balance forms a
sign in the oldest zodiacs of India, and can be traced

anterior to the foundations of this celebrated city.
The Bramins have, indeed, the first pretensions to
a circle of this description of any existing class of
people : they have also a lunai· as well as a solar zo-
diac; the former consisting of twenty-seven stations
or nacshatras, as the latter does of twelve asterisms ς
