DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. VI.

Et recreaverunt vitam, legesque rogarunt;

Et prinize dederunt solatia dulcia vitae,

Quom genuere virum, tali cum corde repertum, ’ 5

Omnia veridico qni quondam ex ore profudit:

Quoius et exstincti, propter divina reperta,

Divolgata vetus jam ad coelum gloria fertur.

Nam, quom vidit hic, ad victum quae flagitat usuS,

Omnia jam ferme mortalibus esse parata,

Et pro quo possent vitam consistere tutam;

terior to Cecrops, and the person who immediately
carried into Attica the religious rites of Da-Mater
and the Ark. The mere etymology of a name, how-
ever, I cannot allow to be a sufficient justification
for such a departure from the general, though,
in some respects, erroneous chronology. Yet the
following passage in Diodorus Siculus, seems to give
additional countenance to this theory, and, at the
same time, strongly supports the assertion of our
poet, that with respect to those countries which con-
stituted, in the opinion of the Romans, the civilized
world, Athens first taught the art and advantages of
agriculture. It will also assist us with an aera for the
commencement of the Athenian monarchy‚ collate-
rally demonstrate, so far as it extends, the truth of
the Hebrew Scriptures, and prove that Erectheus
was contemporary with the patriarch Jacob. ‘⁴ They
assert,'‘ says the histor-ian, Vol. Ι. lib. i. “ that Erec-
theus was by birth an Egyptian, and allege the fol-

lowing motives for his having been made king over
tbe Athenians. At a time when there was cer-

tainly a dreadful famine over every part of the habit-
able world, excepting Egypt, which was preserved by
the Genius of the country, (accurately conceived by
Mr. Allwood to mean the deified Nile) and when a
great destruction followed, both of the fruits of the
earth and of mankind; Erectheus, in as much as
the Athenians and Egyptians were of the same racc,
conveyed a considerable quantity of corn from Egypt

to Attica. On this account, the Athenians, who
were deeply impressed by such an obligation, con-
ferred the kingdom upon their benefactor. When he
had received it, he taught the ceremonials, and insti-
tuted the mysteries of De-Meter at Eleusis, having
brought these rites with him from Egypt.-The
Athenians themselves acknowledged,’' continues he,
“ that, under the govemment of Erectheus, when the
want of rain had consumed all the fruits of the
ground, Demeter (Ceres) had herself come among
them. and relieved their distress by the gift of corn.'’

This passage is of considerable consequence in fix-
ing the date of the reign of this monarch: but it is
so far from proving that he anticipated Cecrops, or
was the earliest king of Athens, that it gives the
Athenians a very high antiquity, and obviously im-
plies that they were, at this period, in a state of consi-
derable cultivation, had an established government,
which was an elective monarchy‚ and, of conse·
quence, that they ntust have been ruled by othe:
princcS, prior to the electiori of this Egyptian chief,
Erectheus. It proves, moreover, that the Atheni-
ans were descendants from the Egyptians; that a
bond of friendship was prevailing between the two
countries‚ and at least allows us to suppose that many
of their prior monarchs may have been immediately of
Egyptian birth3 and so far confirms the general
truth of the royal chronology of Athens, the names
of whose monarchs are au either Egyptian or Chaldaic.
