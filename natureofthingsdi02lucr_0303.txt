THE NATURE OF ΤΗιΝοε.

One ceaseless tenour, limpid and serene.

How move the stars‚ now next the muse shall sing.

Un si vast’ oceam, che parte, e torna
Certo nel moto, e un sol tenor conserva.

Ver. 528. How 'nove the slars, now next the muse
shall sing] The cosmogony of Epicurus, as

we have already seen, embraces the whole of the visi-
ble heavens3 the earth and all the celestia} bodies

being supposed to have originated from the same
chaos at the same period of time· , the cosmogony of

Moses is equally universal, and he is, in this respect,
closely followed by Des Cartes. The theory of Mr.

ι Whitehurst.however, confines itself to the solar system

alone 3 while those of But-net, Whiston, Buffon‚ La
Metherie, Baillie, and Kiuvan, do not extend beyond
&e earth and its appropriate atmosphere3 referring
the sun and the other planets to a different origin.
Des Cartess, like Epicurus, supposes, as 1 have al-
ready observed, that the power of motion was com-
municated to matter sor the grand purpose of crea-
tion 3 and that the chaotic mass, after it was thus en-
dowed, was left to the operation of this mechanical
power alone 3 which, in process oftime, and after the
lapse of many ages, and the exhibition of an infinite va-
riety ofjunctione and disjunctione, decompositions and
recumbiuations, produced and completed the system of
the world, as we behold it at present. The elemen-
tary particles cf matter, upon the system of Epicurus,
are not infinitely divizibk, nor exactly of the same
figure ε they are solid, compact bodies, like the ele-
mentary particles of Sir Isaac Newton ; their figures
can never be changed, and from thiu variation of their
figures is produced the variation in the texture of com-
pound bodies. This subject is fully discusscd in the
first and second *Books of the poem before us. The
elementary matter of Des Canes, however, is infi-
nitely divitibleq and its original particles, which, on
the first endowment of motion, were not perfectly
globular, have all been long since abraded of their
‘angles by reciprocal occursion, by which means 'the
greater part have been rendered completely globular.
The fragments. thus abradet} from the angles of the

quently intertangled, and hereby be rendered fa:- les&
fit for motion than the particles perfectly spherical.
But in the mutual brunt and concussion which must
frequently be taking place between these angular par-
ticlcs3they themselves must frequently also be rendered
globose, or have little globose particles frittered
away from them in the combat : both which kinds of
globular atoms must be inconceivably smaller than
those at first produced from the primal or elementary
particles of chaotic matter. Des Cartes hence sup-
poses the existence of three different species ofinate—
rial atomS, globular of a lai-ger siae, globular of a
smaller‚ and iagged or angular. From the smaller
globulcs, and which, in consequence of their being
smallcr3 are more voluble and active, he conceives
the sun and the sixt stars to have been created ς from
the lai-ger and less active, the etherial lie-avenn and
from those osan angular orjagged shape‚ the earth,
planets, comets, and other meteoric bodies—He con-
ceives, that in the creation of the universe from one
common chaos, a variety ofimmense masses of matter,
from the principle of motion with which they were
endowed, commenced a variety of distinct and perpe.
tual gyrcs or vortices, extending through the entire
substance of which each mass consisted : that each of
these masses thus commcncing a separate whirl, laid
the foundation for a distinct planctui-y system: that
every such mass was coinpounded of the three orders
of elementary particlcs just enumerated3 and that in
consequence of such perpetnny of motion, every
classilication of orbs. within the range of the visible
heau-nn, was gradually explicate-d and arranged3 the
sinest globulcs, as l have just observcd, constituting.

teins than our owni3 aud thc larger wearing, {922
