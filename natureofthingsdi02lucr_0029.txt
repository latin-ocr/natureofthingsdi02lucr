THE NATURE OF THINGS.

The mind discerns not3 for such viewless flakes

Live, doubtleSS, o'er each surface loose diffus’d,

Rang'd ever equal, and with ampler ease

Dispell'd, since gender’d of a lighter frame,

And in the front of objects fixt supreme.

For sight not merely bodies marks minute

Thrown from th’ interior, or the base profound, 7 5

As prov'd already, but, like rain-bow hues,

Pour’d from the surface. This the crowd surveys

Oft in the theatre, whose curtains broad,

Bedeck’d with crimson, yellow, or the tint

Of steel cerulean, from their Huted heights

Each marble statue, and the rising tows

Of rank and beauty, fiing their tint superb.

Per malos volgata trabesque, trementia fluctant.

simple, unornamentcd woof, and merely resortcd to

To this tremulous drapery of the theatre, Proper-
tius alludes in his Elegies, lib. ii. :

Nec sinuosa cavo pendebant vela theatro :

Nor o’er the concavc theatra: was hung
The folding curtains.

And Lucretius himself, more fully still, in Book vi.

tending· and opposite clouds to their cmckling bc-
neath the bret-ze.
