THE NATURE OF THINGS.

And why, moreo’er, the temples of the gods,

Why his own altars, with the fiesy Storm

Fells he, promiscuous? into atoms why

Rends their best statue33 and, with frantie aim,

E'en from himself his image-honours wrest?

Or o'er the hills why hurls he chief his ire,

The rocks abrupt, and mountains most sublime?

Hence, with much ease, the mereor may we trace

a

cloud is tenser, in more regular and unbroken pro-
tuberances. Retaining, then, these simple facts in
our recollection, it will not be difficult to account
for the pbaenomenon of the prester, or water-spent,
upon the principles of the electric theory.

A thunder·clond‚ or cloud filled with electric
matter, is first noticed to appear at sea in a sky so
serene aa to be totally destitute of adscititious clouds,
and in an atmosphere so dry, as to be possest of
very little impalpable vapour. Such is the general
appearance of the horizon on the commencement
of the water-spout. In such a situation, a thunder-
stoi-m cannot be the result, for want of the confede-
rate assistance of additional clouds and vapours ε but,
from tlie circumstances enumerated above, a very con-
siderable portion of mutual attraction must take place
between this isolated cloud, and the portion of the
sea immediately beneath it, more especially if tlic
sea be at this time negative-ly electrisscd, or destitute
of the electric power of which the cloud lias a. unt
nui-plus. From this mutual attracti0n‚ the water di-
rectly under the cloud will become protuberant up-
ward⁸‚ rising like a hill towards the cloud above,
which, in the phaenomenon we are now describing.

it always does, and the cloud above will become pro- n

tuber-ant downwards, elongating itself towards the
v elevated portion of water beneath. lf¹ in this action
of straining, the texture of the cloud be very slight,

electric matter contained within it u ill be qnixriy
dissipated, or attracted to the οειῑιιις bu: if it be
stronger and more viscous, it will continue to stre-teli
without bursting; and, like every othei· clastic sul>-
stancc, the more it stretches, tlte narmi-:cr will hc
the projected tube. Such, to the mariner, is the
actual appearance of the column of the water-sp0nt‚
precisely resembling a speaking-trumpct, with its
base or broadcr part uppermost. llecn the mouth
ofthis projected tube touches the ming liillock <f
water, if the attraction of tlte utstatim-ly electi-nied
ocean be superior, the tlt-ctric aura, we: may natn-
rally suppose, will be drawn downwards, and llic
empty cloud bc totally dissiparem but. as will gc-
nerally occur in the case of a positive sorr: applied
to a negative. if tlxc antrat-tion ol' the ‹lta-tric cloud
prove victorious, it nill continue to snrk up the
rising hillock of water till it is altogether mtto, and
