DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. V.

Quo tot facta virum totiens cecidere3 neque usquam,

AEternis famae monimentis insita, florent?

330

Verum, ut opinor, habet novitatem summa recensque

Natura mundi est3 neque pridem exordia cepit.

Qu& re etiam quaedam nunc artes expoliuntur3

Nunc etiam augescunt :

Multa ;

nunc addita navigiis sunt

modo organicei melicos peperere sonores ε

Denique, Natura haec Rerum, ratioque, reperta est

Nuper; et hanc, primus cum primis ipse repertus

N une ego sum, in patrias qui possim vortere voces.

Quod, si forte fuisse antehac eadem omnia credis,

Sed periisse hominum torrenti secla vapore,

lusion to that miraculous event. The date of this

poem. therefore, we possess ; its perfectiori intimates
that it was preceded by others. Of the general sci-
ence of the antediluviau world, we know little more
timu by rational conjecture; the race that could
creet enies, and construet such a vessel as the ark‚
mast have made great advances in the circle of the
arts and seiences. They must have been excellent
mecha-aies», and geometricians‚ must have been ac-

qwaintcd with the knowledge and use of metals, and

other fossils, and well skilltd in navigation. They

were al÷0 agriculturists‚ and cultivators of the vine.
To which va=ious kinds of knowledge, Josephus
adds, that they were acquainted with letters, and
that Noah took with him, into the ark, a regular

history ot* thc antediluvian world, and of its progress ’

in scicnce. He attributes the invention of writing

and engi-aving to Seth, who erected two pillars, and
engi-ared on them his astronomic discoveries. Lib. i. 3.

cannot, in this place, but be reminded of the fol-
lowing verses of Horace.

Vixere fortes ante Agamemnona
Multi ι sed omnes illacrymabiles
Urgentur ignotique longa
Nocte, carent quia vate sacro.
OD. iv. 9.

Ere Agamemnon many a brave man sprung.
Yet unbemoan’ d they fell, and void of glory,

By night‘ s oblivious shades o ’erhung;

For hard divine ne ’er told their story.
