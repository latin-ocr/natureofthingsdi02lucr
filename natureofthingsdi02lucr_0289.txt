THE NATURE OF THINGS.

ι As fables tell, and delug’d many a state3

Till, in its turn, the congregated waves

By cause more potent conquer’d, heaven restrain'd

Its ceaseless torrentS‚ and the floods decreas'd.

But from this boundless mass of matter first

How heaven, and earth, and ocean, sun, and moon,

Rose in nice order, now the muse shall tell.

For never, doubtless, from result of thought,

Or mutual compact, could primordial seeds

First harmonize, or move with powers precise.

From time eternal‚ by intrinsic weight,

This, and several of the ensuing verses, are repeated
with but little variation from Book Ι. 1080 : to
the Note on which passage l refer the reader for an
explanation. That the doctrine here elucidated, was
that of Epicurus, wc have an additional authority in
the following sentence, aptly cited by Lambinus,
from Plutarch. De Placit. Philosoph. i. 4. 'Oa-01

Buffon and Dr. Herse-hen. ir. Note on v. 4: 3. of this
Book. Epicurus, like our own ingenuinus country-
man, supposed the existence of a vast mass of elc-
mentary matter in the centn-c os thc universe: al-

.ὐτο ative or formative power.

though, from the immensity of the universe itself, and
its total want of bounds, he saw an evidcnt impro- ·
priety in applying the term centre to any portion of
space of which it cons-ists. From this vast mass and
fountain of matter, primitive or elementary atonis are
perpetually flowing forth, and have been, accmding
to the Epicurean system, from all eternity. They
are all cndowed with a creative or formative appe-
tency, which very closely corresponds with the New-

tonian principle of gravitatum ; and immediately with
