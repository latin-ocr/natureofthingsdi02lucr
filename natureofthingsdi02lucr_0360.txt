DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. V.

Nam cupide fugere feras, pacemque sequutae

Sunt, et larga suo sine pabula parta labore τ

Quae <lamus utilitatis eornm praemia caussa.

At, queis nihil horum tribnit Natura, neque ipsa

Sponte su& possent ut vivere, nec (lare nobis

870

Utilitatem aliquam, qud re pateremur eorum

Prcesidio nostro pasci genus, esseque tutum3

Scilicet haec aliis praedae, lucroque, jacebant

Indupedita suis fatalibus omnia vinclis,

Donec ad interitum genus id Natura redegit.

875

Sed neque Centaurei fuerant, nec tempore in ullo

Esse queunt3 duplici natur& et corpore bino

Ex alienigenis membris conpacta potestas,

Hinc illinc par vis ut non sic esse potissit ε

Id licet hinc quam vis hebeti cognoscere corde.

Ver. 896. γει CENrAmzs liv’d not ;—--] The
Centaur was an imaginary monster, with its upper
part resembling the form ofa man, and its lower that
of a horse. Its existence was credimd, not only by
the people and the poets, but also by several of the
philosophers. Empedocles countenanced the creed,
and Pliny positively declares, that he once beheld one
himself: “ Hippocentaurum,'’ says he, “in Thes-
salia natum eodem die interiisse3 et nos principatu
rjus allatum illi ex JEgypto in melle vidimus.’' A
Centaur was born in Thessaly, and died the same day,
and 1 myself saw it, when, by the command of Clau-
dius Caesar, it was brought to him from Egypt, em·
halmcd in honey.'' There can bc no doubt, however,
:liat this was nothing more than the monstrous fetus

s

of some beast, bearing a kind of resemblance to this
imaginary prodigy, and which the well-known credu-
lity of the Roman naturalist interpreted into a perfect
animal. Our poet, in thorough consonance with the
principles of his own system, has ingeniously ac-
counted for the origin of such a belief, as well as that
of all othei· monsters ofa similar kind, in Book IV.
756, by supposing them to be the crude and fanciful
conjunctions of the silmy emanations of different ani-
mals in the atinosphere:

For the wild semblance of a centaur yet

Ne’er flowed from centaurs living ; nature

such
Creating never ; but when once in air
A man’s light image with a horse’s meets,
