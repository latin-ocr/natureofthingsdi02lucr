DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. IV.

Nec simili penetrant aureis primordia forma,

Quom tuba depresso graviter sub murmure mugit,

Et revocat raucum retro cita barbara bombum 3

550

Et valli cycnis, nece tortis, ex Heliconis

Quom liquidam tollunt lugubri voce querelam.

Hasce igitur penitus voceS‚ quom corpore nostro

Exprimfflms, rectoque foras emittimus ore,

Mobilis articulat, verborum daedala, lingua,

555

Formaturaque labrorum pro parte figurat.

Ver. 564. When roars the deep-ton'd trumpet, or the

horn] So various are the different lections of

the original corresponding to this and the three suc·

ceeding verses, that it is impossible to reconcile them.
1 have chosen that preferred by Wakefield:

Qom tuba depresso graviter sub murmure mu-
git,

Et revocat raucum retro cita barbara bombum

Et valli cycnis, nece tortis, ex Heliconis

Quam liquidam tollunt lugubri voce querelam.

In the common editions they occur thus ι

Qom tuba depresso graviter sub murmure mu-
git,

Aut roboant raucum retrocita cornua bombum :

V ollibus et cycni gelidis orti ex Heliconis

Cum liquidam tollunt lugubri voce querelam.

In many codices they appear in a different form
atill. Vossius, sor retro cita, proposes Berecynthia,
and the proposal was approved by Bentley; yet
scarcely nothing, as WVakscfield observes, can be

more audacious or remote from the semblance of
truth.

In the Bolognian collection of Pius, the second
verse of the above tetrastich appears thus ε

Et reflexa retro dant cornua barbara bombum.

In the third verse, the different copies vary still
more. Wakefield's is the only one that is both in-
telligent and metrical ς and to render it thus, he has
been under the necessity of making one or two lite·
ral alterations. For these, however, the admirere, of
Lucretius must be obliged to him. The translations
of these contested lines are, in general, mere para-

phrases, particularly the French of des Cout'ures
and the Italian of Marchetti.

Ver. 566. And when the swan, amid the pangs qs
death,

Pours o’er PARNASSUS his last liquid dirge.]
Thus imitated by Garcilaso dela Vega, in his Ec-

logues, who, 1 have already observed, was fond of
this traditionary simile ι
