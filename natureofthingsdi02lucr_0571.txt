THE NATURE OF THINGS.

So through the well-spring that the flax inflames

Burst forth the lurking fire-seeds to the day,

. Commingling with its fibres; which achiev’d,

Or with the torch once blended, all is blaze;

Themselves alike high-charg’d with latent fire.

When, just extinct, the taper we apply

To one full blazing, see’st thou not how soon,

E’en ere it touch, th’ extinguish'd snuff relumes ?

Relumes not thus the torch, too? and alike

Full many a substance, useless to recount,

At distance kindled ere the flame arrive?

So acts the fountain, such the cause conceal'd.

And next explain we by what curious law

Whether the ancients were acquaintcd with that
most useful nautical instrument to which the proper-
ties of this stone have given birth, the mariner’s com-
pass, is in some degree doubtful. In modern En-
rope, we have no decisive knowledge ofthe existence
of this instrument anterior to its use by Marco Polo,
in 1260. Among the Cliinese, however, it appears
to have been employed immemorially: from which
circumstance, many scholars of high reputation, aud
among the rest my learned and indefatigable friend
the rcv. T. Maurice, conceives that other ancient na-
tions were in an equal degree acquainted with its uti-
lity. They contend, that it was known to the Dru-
ids, and that the cardinal points of what they call
the Druidic temples at Stonehenge and Abury, were
determiued by the use of such a compass. In like
manner, aser-ibing its name of lapis Heraclius, or
Herculeus, ω Hercules au its inventor, they conjec-
ture it was known also to the Greeks; and that
the golden cup which Apollo, or the sun under

that denominatim, gave to Hercules, was nothing
more or less than the mariner’s compass-box, by
which, not in which, the latter sailed over the
vast ocean; they add also, that thc golden flcece and
the golden scyphus in the temple of Jupiter Ammon
in Lybia, were nothing more than types of this cu-
rious instrument. I am afraid, however, there is
more ingenuity iu such conjectures than solid argu-
ment or historic fact: and in addition to the obscr-
vations :ulvanced on thc other side of the question by
Sir william Temple, Dr. XVotton, nud Mt. Clarke,
l cannot avoid rtmnrking, that had this instrument
been known iu the time of Lucu-ttius, lie would not
lun-c [tiled to have adverted to it on the present oc-
casion. But it is neither mentioned b)- Lueretius
nor hy Sindus.
