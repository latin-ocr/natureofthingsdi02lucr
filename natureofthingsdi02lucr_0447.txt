ATHENS, of peerless name, to savage man
First taught the blessings of the cultur’d field,

which obviously exists in this arrangement, it is suf-
ficient to destroy its veracity. to point out the pre-
tended origin of several of these princes. Amphic-
tyon, the third in the catalogue, is generally stated
to have been the son of Deucalion, the only male
preserved amidst the general devastation of the de-
luge, and consequently can quadrate with no other
person than Noah. Erectheus was a γηγενης, οι- Τί-
tan, produced immediately from the Ean-th, and
Cecrops, an αυτοχθων, or Titan, who sprang up
from the Earth in Attica itself, the very country in
which hc resided. To free this account from such
chronological errors and absurdities, Sir Isaac New-
ton conjectured that Pandion Il. who is represented
as succeeding the second Cecrops, was the same with
Pandion 1. and Erectheus the same with Erectho-
nius: a conjecture that will strike off one hundred
and fifteen years from the period of three hundred
and fifty-nine, which includes the whole compass of

gical catalogue with a still greater freedom. From
the etymology os the names of these Athenian
princes, he seems to suppose, consistently‚ indeed,
with hin general theory, that scarcely any os them

neric names alone, by which different colonica of
wandering Cushites were denominated. This, how-
ever, is using the axe with too liberal a hand. There
can be no doubt that all the different provinces of
Greece were either originally peopled by different
colonica migmting from Egypt, in a manner some-
what similar to the tribes of wandering ἐφείω, or
Egypeians of the present day, or that, if these
provinces were peopled antecedently. they were
subjugated by such foreign intrudcrs. l’rnt l think
it is highly probable. that every tribe thus wander-
ing towards Greece. had a chief or superior. uhose
