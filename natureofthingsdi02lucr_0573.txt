Th’ obsequious iron3 magnet term’d since firs}

Mid the MAGNETES men its power descried.

Vast is the wonder, mid th’ admiring crowd,

This stone excites; for oft a pendent chain

Forms it of rings unlink’d and loosely join’d.

And frequent see they, sporting in the breeze,

Such rings quintupled, in succession long,

The lowlier cleaving to the sphere above,

And this to that, proclaiming, as it hangs,

Its deep—felt conscience of the magnet’s power.-

Such the resistless energy it boasts.

In facts like these full many abtruth profound

First must we prove, erc yet their power thou trace,

And many a maze unravel 3—-tbou with heed

as much force to break them as to break the frag-

sufficient to produce induration when diffused through
