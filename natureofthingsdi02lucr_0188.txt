DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. lv.

Labitur interea τες, et vadimonia fiunt ;

Languent obficia, atque aegrotat fama vacillans:

Unguenta, et pulchra in pedibus Sicyonia, rident·

Scilicct3 et grandes viridi cum luce smaragdei

Auro includuntur, teriturque thalassina vestis

Et bene parta patrum fiunt anademata, mitrae3

——the grey morn
Lifts her pale lustre on the paler wretch
Exanimatc by love. Spumo-
So solomon, among many other resemblances of

our poet, Prov. v. 8. 11.

Turn back thy path far from her;

Approach not the door ofher house :—

Lest thou bitterly bewail at the last,

'When thy flesh and thy body become macerated.

Neglected fortune flies 3 and sliding swift,

Prone into ruin fall his scorn'd affairs :—

His brightest flames extinguish’d all, and all

His brightcst moments running down to waste.

of this favourite catachresis of our poet 1 have already

 

had frequent occasions of commenting. See Note on
v. 85. of this Book. The ungnents and persumes made
use ofin former ages, and applied to every part of
the body, arc almost innumerable. Our modern
extravagance, in this respect, is notlung to what

Atbcnaeus relates existed in his aera, when it was the
custom to apply a different essence, of which every
one was very expensive, to almost every limb; the
Egyptian to the feet and legs 3 the Phoenician to the
cheeks and bosom ς the Sisymbrian to the arms 3 and
the Amaracine to the neck and knees.

It is truly curious, indeed, to observe the univer-
sality of this fashion of applying unguenta to the
whole, or the greater part of the body among man-
kind, in every age, and every state of society. At
the very time that it thus prodigally prevailed among
the polite and voluptuous nations of Greece and
Rome, it was equally in vogue among the barbarous
inhabitants of Britain. Nor have modern adventurers
discovered the existence of any people whatsoever,
where it has not been found a custom established im-
memorially amongst them. The polite Otaheitan,
and the stupid Eskimaux; the active Chinese, and
the indolent Arab‚ the beautiful Circassian, aud the
deformed Caffw, the negro of Gambia‚ and the olive-
coloured Caribbee, all equally in every variety of
climate and of manners, exliibit a fondness for un-
guents. Among Europeans, these ungueuts are ge· ff
nerally applied to the head and face, aud to no other
part of the body: among the Georgians‚ the head
and face are left perfectly free, but the body ie uni-
