THE NATURE OF THINGS'.

321

Why then, alike, may different streams of air

Bend not the stass, the planets through their paths ἓ

Then night, at length, the world with darkness shrouds,

Or since the sun, at heaven's remotest verge,

666

Tir’d with his toil, his remnant lamp blows out,

Curtail'd already by the racc achiev'd

tion, or even change. According to the literal inter-
pretation of the sacred Scriptores, the sun, at the
time appointed for his formation, which was the morn-

“ ing of the fourth day, was created instantaneously by

the rapid efflux of the partic-les of light and beat to
one common point, whose cor.centration and conglo-

. bation formed his radiant body. And the phaenome-

non which is thus represented as having occurred on
the fourth morning of creation, these philosophers
maintained was repeated in the same precise manner
every morning. lt is to such opinion Horace mani-
festly allodes in the following verses, in his Carmen
Seculare :

Alme Sol ! curru nitido diem qui

Promis et celas, aliusque et idem

Nasceris.

Sun benign ! whose car of flame
Opes and shuts the punctual day,
Another born, yet still the same-

Gassendi has endeavoured to explain this opinion
of Xenophanes, by suppos-ing hizn to believe, that as
the ocean encornpassed the earth, the sun was actually
extinguished every evening by ita waters iu the west,

t and returned all along through the waves in a north-

ward directiou to the east. where he again amended,
and wau re-kindled every morning. Nothing, how-
ever, can be more wild and unphilosophic than such
an interpretation ; and nothing cau bc farther from
the express declaration of our poet. He delineutts
the sun as gradually augmenting in bulk and vigour,
till he has gained his meridiani rnaturity : after which
he, aa progressive-ly, diuniuishes both iu power and sub-
nance, till, at length. he dics away. and is absolutely
dissipatcd τ the expression in the following line,

Tired with his toil his remnant lamp blows out.
And in the original, ver. 631 :

 

suos ecflavit lar-guidus igneis,
is entirely figurative, nor marc figurative than beauti-
ful: it is thus imitated by Virgil :
——alto se gurgite tollunt
Solis cqm‘, lucemque clasis nariJm gyssam.
AEx. xii. ¹¹2²·

Now from the stream the sun‘s bright eoursers επεν,
And with wide nefariis kind& up the day. ·
The whole passage, however, as M. De Lille has
anticipated mein observing, is still more fully imi-
tated in his Georg. i. 247, in which we clearly per-
ceive that Virgil, who had at this time abandoned the
Epicurean philosophy, doubted whether he should
admit, with the stoica, of antipodal inhabitants, and
an antipodal sky ι
Illic, ut perhibent, aut intempesta silet uox
Szmper, ct obtenta densantur nocte teuebrae ς
Aut redit {i nobis Aurora, diemqne reducit:
Nosque ubi primns· equis oriens afflavit anhelis,
Iilic sera rubeus aseendit lumina Vesper.
There, as they say, deep silence loves to rect,
Am] endless right ui teu-fold gioom opprest ;
Or, from our hernisphere, the morning ray
ReturuS, alternate. aud restores ilie day ς
And when to us the orient car sinceris,
And o'er our clunes have brt-ath'd its pauting
siccas,
'l'hcre ruddy Vesper, kindliug up the sky,
Casts o'er the glowiug reahns lus ere-*rung eye.
