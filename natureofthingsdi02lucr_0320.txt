DE RERUM NATURA.

[211³. V.

Quanto quaeque magis sint terram sidera propter,

Tanto posse minus cum coeli turbine ferri:

Evanescere enim rapidas illius, et aereis

Inminui subter, vireis; ideoque relinqui

Paullatim solem cum posterioribus signis,

Inferior multum quod sit, quam fervida signa:

Et magis hoe lunam ; quanto demissior ejus

Cursus abest procul a coelo, terrisque propinquat,

Tanto posse minus cum signis tendere cursum.

Flaccidiore etiam quanto jani turbine fertur,

Inferior quam sol, tanto magis omnia signa

Hanc adipiscuntur circum, praeterque feruntur.

Propterea fit, ut haec ad signum quodque revorti

naturally conceive, in the first instance, very few
and simple, and, perhaps, the hypothesis of Demo-
critus here adverted {0 fibyVJssu-getius, Qaybhav-ej §gen
,the earliest erected upon this foundation. 1(γὲξέ-
poses the existence of not more than three :V one Qffi:
prizing tlte orbit of the Vmoon, εγιῗῐγιάἶείῖγιιιλγῑεᾴἶ nearest
the earth; a second, jofjlgger diameter, inclosing
it, in which the sun and planetsri'evolved together3
and a third, encompassing the two former, placed
in the sublimen boundary of the heavens, and con·
stituting the orbit os the starry constellations. This
simple hypothesis was undoubtedly well calculated to
explain several of the phaenomena of the celestial
bodies, but it would not explain many: and other
spheres or orbits were, in consequence, progressively
added by future astronomers‚ till, in the age of
manasterio, they amounted to not less than seventy-
four, and the system at length fell a sacrifice to its
own confusion and complexity. One of the easicst

 

diagrams of this hypothesis may be obtained by
throwing a stone into a still sheet of water. Hence
the following verses of Dr. Donne :

If, as in water stirr’d, more circlcs be
Produc’d by one, love such additions take,

Those, like so many spheres, but one heaven
make,

For they are all concentric unto thee.
Lovz’s Gaowri-i.

A simile which has been obviously borrowed by

MrMPope, in the ensuing admirable lines of his Essay
on an :

God loves from whole to parts ; but human soul
Ivlust rise from individuals to the whole.
Self-love but serves the virtnous mind to wake,
As the small pebble stirs the peaceful lake.

The centre mov'd, a circle strait succeeds,

Another mu, and stili another spreadu.
