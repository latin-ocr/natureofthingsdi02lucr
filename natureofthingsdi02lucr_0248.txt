DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. V.

Proptereaque putes, ritu par esse Gigantum

Pendere eos poenas inmani pro scelere omneis,

Quei ratione sust disturbent moenia mundi,

Praeclarumque velint coeli restinguere solem„

Inmortalia mortali sermone notantes:

Quae procul usque adeo divino a numine distent,

Inque desim numero quae sint indigna videri;

Notitiam potius praebere ut posse putentur,

ης

Quid sit vitali motu, sensuque, remotum..

Quippe et enim non est, cum quo vis corpore ut esse

Posse animi natura putetur, consiliumque:

Sic, ut in aethere non arbor, non aequore salso

planets. Of the former opinion were Pythagoras,
TrismegistuS, Plato, and'Aristotle : and theyjudged,
that such a tenet was necessary in order to account
for the admirable harmony and connexion of the dis·
ferent parts of the comprehensive whole. Thus, says
Cicero, in delivering the crccd of Plato, Academ.
Quaest. lib. r. ⁴‘ The several members of the world,
and all things contained in them, are uphcld together
by a sensitive nature, which posscsses also the tndow-
ment of perfect reason. This sensitivc nature is,
morem-er, sempiternal ς for there is nothing stronger
than itself‚ and by the power of which it can pos-
sibly be dissolu-d: and its denomination with us is
the soul of the world.’'

And that Cicero reporta the Platonic creed upon
this subject fairly, we know from the following, as
well as othei· accordant passages of Plato himself, in
which ht represents the earth, and every other planet,
as possest of a rational soul ;—as a perfect animal
composed of perfect parts: as a god possessing the

full fruition of selicity. Σωον ultor εκ τελε-ἰν των-μερω

The soul of the world, upon the system of Plato,
resided principally in the (entre of the material uni-
verse: chalcidius, however, conceived its head-quar-
ters to be established in the sun ; but Cicero himself
differed from each of these opinions, and maintained,
with the Stoics in gener-al, that every one of the ce-
lcstial bodies, endowed with motion, was equally to
be ranked in the number of the gods. Thus Lu-
cilius, quoted by Cicero as delivering the senti-
ments of their common school: ‘⁴ Hanc igitur in
stellis constantiam, hanc tantam in tam variis casibus,

§ymo-ono.
