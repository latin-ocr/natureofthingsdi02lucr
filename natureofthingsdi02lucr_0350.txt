By this common expression our poet includes obvi-
ously both man and beast :

 

Tum tibi terra dedit primum mortalia secla.

Ver. 803.
And the origin of both he supposes to have been
ahke: a dogma acceded to by almost every other
school of Grecian philosopher: as well as that of Epi-
curus. The economy of their creation is so rni-
nntely detailed by Lucretius, as to require no com—

Anaximander, however, made no distinction, in his
theory, between birds and other animals: asserting
that they were all equally produced from little uterine
membranes, similar, in their first formation, to the
films that are often found in stagnant fens and marshes
upon a sudden recurrence of sultry weather. See
Note on v. 818. of the present Book. The Stoice,
as we learn from‘Lactantius, admitted nearly the
same general theory 3 it was their belief, says he, in
omnibus terris et agris, tanquam fungos, esse gene—
ratos: “that they were generated like fungi or
mushrooms over every field and country.” And
consistently with our poet’s account of the first nu-
trition of animals, Lactantius repeats from Arche-
laus, ii. 4. Ortos e terra, quae limum similem lacti
ad escam eliquaverit: “ that they sprang from the
earth, which oozed out, for their nutrition, a te-
naciousjuice like milk.’¹ There were, undoubtedly,
several other opinions entertained upon this recon-
dite subject by the poets and philosophers, but this
advanced hythe Epicureans and Stoics, was the most
esteemed, and by far the most beautiful: the gene-

rality of the rest, indeed, are too wild and incohe-
rent to be worthy of a moment’s notice.

 

This common theory of the two schools is more-
over‚ particularly entitled to attention, from its ana-
logy with the natural history of the present day.
The Epicureans and Stoics, according to Lactan-
tius, affirmed that mankind, as well as most other
animals, were first generated, and drew their earliest
subsistente from a nidus of “fungi scattered over
every field and country.’‘ Dr. Darwin, in his obser-
vations upon this order of plants, but without the
remotest reference to any such opinion, observes,
in the seventh section οἱ the last Book of his Phyto-
logia, that “ the fungi appear to be animals without
locomotion, whose lactea! vessels are inserted into
the earth, like those of vegetables, but whose gilio
or lunge are‘ covered from the light, like those of
animale, but exposed to the open air like the leaves
or lungs of vegetables. Another curious occurrence,
which seems to associate them with animals, if the
truth can be depended upon, is, that some of them
are of animal origin, as the common mushroom is
said certainly to be procured from horse-dung.” Ι
am not writing to corroborate the fancies of this in-
genious philosopher—but merely to shew, without,
perhaps, his having been sensible of it himself—that
this association of some species of fungi with ani.
mals, was admitted, even in a greater degree, by
the schools os Epicurus and Zeno, who, like the
present naturalist, regarded them not only as aspeeies f
of “ animals without locomotion, and with the posses.
sion of lacteal vessels,” but as the nidus of almost
all other animals, whom they nourished, first of all,
by an uterine capsule, and afterwards by these very
lactea! vessels themselves. It is in consequence of
observations somewhat similar, that M. Buillon le
Grange has denominated the common truffie, lyco-
perdon tuber, which ranks in the order of fungi, an

aalmalized vegetable. See Annales de Chirnie. vol.
xlvi.

The only instance in which this theory appears to
be inconsistent with the Mosaic account, according ⁴
to its ordinary interpretation, is in the suppositioni
