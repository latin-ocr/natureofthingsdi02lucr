Βοοκ IV. THE NATURE OF THINGS. 143

No latent atom left, as sparks that lurk
In smother’d embers, whence its powers afresh
Might blaze, triumphant, with recover’d flame.

Yet by what means this wond'rous change resultS‚ 950
Whence fails the soul, aud all the body droops,
Now mark, nor let the dictates waste in air.

Know then all ether, that around us flows,
Beats on the body, open to its force,
With ceaseless repercussion. Nature hence, 95 5
To check its, fury, oft the tendes frame
With skin surrounds, hair, bark, or painted shells.
Nor ceases here th’ assault ; the breeze inhal'd
Winds, too, through all the system, and each duct
Lashes amain with every fleeting breath. 960
Since with a two—fold foe, then, nature, thm,
Through all her depths‚ through all her pores minute,
Strives ceasele55‚ ruin by degrees must threat:
For each primorclial seed is deep derang'd
Of mind and body3 while th' enfeebl'd soul‚ 965
By transudation shorn, concentrates part
In the deep vitals‚ and in part still roams

Through all the limbs distracted, seed from seed
