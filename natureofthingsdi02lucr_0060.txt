DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. IV.

Nunc ea, quae nobis membrorum dextera pars est,

In speculis fit, utei laev& videatur, eo quod

Planitiem ad speculi veniens quom obfendit imago,

295

Non convortitur incolomis3 sed recta retrorsum

Sic eliditur, ut si quiS, prius arida quam sit

Cretea persona, adlidat pilaeve, trabive:

Atque ea continuo, rectam si fronte figuram

Servet, et elisam retro sese exprimat ipsa,

300

Fiet, et ante oculos fuerit qui dexter, ut idem

Nune sit laevus, et e laevo sit mutua dexter.

Fit quoque, de speculo in speculum ut tradatur imago:

Quinque, etiam sex, ut fieri simulacra suerint.

Nam, quaequomque retro, parte interiore, latebit,

305

Inde tamen, quam vis torte penitusque remota,

Omnia, per flexos aditus educta, licebit

Pluribus haec speculis videantur in aedibus esse:

Ver. 302. Hence, not the meanti! marvtl can attach]
The 'deduction summai-ily exhibited in this and the
two following verses, corresponding with ver. 200—
292. of the original, is capriciously omitted by Lam-
binus, who has been followed both by Creech and
Marchetti in their respective translations. Creech,
however, in his Latin edition, has thought proper to
retain the passage; although he has appended a
note, in which he justifies the suppression of Lambi-
nus. Iu Mr. Wakefield, the verses are pre ewed as

they ought to be; and even Des Comus-es has justly
rernarked‚ that there is no doubt that they belong
to Lucretius, and are necessary to the subject 3
“ cette manierc‚’' adds he, “ pour conclure une pro·
position lui est familiere,’' and he immediately adduces
instances of the same kind of termination from Book 1.
ver. 296. of the original, as also from one or two
other places, in which the same phraseology it in·
troduced.
