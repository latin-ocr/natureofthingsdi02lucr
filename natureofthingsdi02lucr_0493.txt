Βοοκ Vs. THE NATURE OF THINGS. 479

Borne· tow’rds the spot that feels its final brunt.
Where long the ssight, moreo’er‚ the substance wing'd 345
Augments in haste, and swist, and swifter still
Flows ever on, and sturdier strikes its blow:
For seed with seed condenses as they rusb,
Press'd to one central focus, till, at length,
Falls with full force th' agglomerated shock :⁴ 3 50
Join'd, too, perchance, by atoms drawn from air
VVhose ceaseless lash gave pinions to its speed.
Then many a frame the missile bolt pervades‚
And leaves unhurt, its pores the liquid fire
Transpiercing unresisted; while, revers’d, 35 5
Full many a frame it shatters, since the seeds
Igneous with those th’ objective mark that rear,
And stamp it solid, in close conflict meet.

Thus brass with ease, thus, instantaneOUS‚ gold
