Hoc super in coeli spatio, coiere repente

Asperiora; modis quae possint indupedita

Exiguis tamen inter se conpressa teneri.

Haec faciunt primum parvas consistere nubeis:

Inde ea conprendunt inter se, conque gregantur,

hillock of rising water; so that, by the time this

elongating spout extends to the attracted hillock, it
is totally incapable of containing any thing farther.

Ver. 466. —marble maim] The elegant epithet.
introduced into this verse, representative at once ofthe
ocean as to splendour of polish and whiteness of foam,
is not unsrequent with our poet. Thus, Book 11. 766 ι

 

mare, cum magni commorant aequora venti,
Vertitur in canos candenti marmore fluctus.

Nor has this beanty been neglected by our English
poets. Hence, Dytr :

 

the flat sea shines like yellow gold

'Fused in the five ; or like llse maz-blestoor

Of some old temple wide. But where so wide
In old or later time, its marblefloor

Did ever temple hoast as this, which here
Spreads its bright level many a league around ?
Fures, iv.

And thus Milton, holder still:

Round he surveys

 

and winds with ease

 

Through the pure tam-lale air his oblique way.

Ver. 467. ‘The rise qs clouds next calls us. ]
Our poet's explanation of this phaenomenon of natu-
ral history does not essentially deviate from the doc-

 

trine of modern philosophy upon the same subject.—
Clouds, iic tells us, are a congeries of various subtle
and attenuate bodies, loosely scattered through the

atmosphere; as water. air, aud the igneous aura of
lightning. Their substance, however, is principally
aqueous vapour; and this vapour‚ he affirms, is ex-
haled indiscriminately from the summits oflofty moun-
tains, from the surface of riv'ers, seas, and even the
general bosom of the earth itself: while it occasionally
happens, that the incipient cloudlets arrest, in their
descent, immense multitudes of those primal atoms of
matter that are perpetually urged from world to world
through all the abyss of space, and enter this visible
sphere of things through the poroua confines of the
horizon, for the purpose of sustaining it with fresh
pabulum ; consistently with the doctrine advanced in
the first two Books of the poem. And hence the poet
accounts for that abrupt appearance of enormous
clouds of excessivc depth and pitchy blackness with
which the atmosphere is frequently loaded. These
aqucous vapours ascending from the earth, are at first
too attenuate to be visible 3 but as they mount into
a cooler region, every distinct vcsicle becomes con-
densed, vast multitudes of thern congregate, and
a larger vesicle or cloudy film of irregular shape
is immediately engendered perceptible to the eye.
From the junction of such aqueous films in every di-
rection, superior, inferior, and horizontah a perfect
cloud is completed, whose magnitude depends upon
the adscititious nebulae or cloudlets it is capable of
absorbing into its own vortex, or the quantity of un-
condensed and invisible vapours that lie within the
sphere of ite attraction of cohesion. Upon the co-
lours assumed by the clouds, I have already cursorily
observed‚ in Note on the present Book, ver. 210. and
perhaps the best treatise upon the subject sor further
