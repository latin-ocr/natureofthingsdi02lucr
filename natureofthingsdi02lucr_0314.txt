Flammarum, nihil ad speciem est contractior ignis.

DE RERUM NATURA.

Proinde, calor quoniam solis lumenque profusum

Perveniunt nostros ad sensus, et loca fulgent;

Forma quoque hine solis debet filumque videri,

Nihil adeo ut possis plus, aut minus, addere vere.

Lunaque, sive notho fertur loca lumine lustrans,

Sive suo proprio jactat de corpore lucem 3

Quidquid id est, nihilo fertur majore figura,

Quam nostris oculis, qua cernuum, esse videtur.

Nam prius omnia, quae longe semota tuemur

Aera per multum, speeie confusa videntur,

Quam minui filum : quapropter luna necesse est,

Quandoquidem claram speciem certamque figuram

Praebet, ut est oris extremis quomque notata,

Quanta quoque est, quanta, hinc nobis videatur in alto.

Postremo, quosquomque vides hinc aetheris igneis,

The sun was not supposed, by our poet, to vary
much from his apparent magnitude3 the real and ap-
parent magnitude of the moon he conceived to differ
aa little. The reasons he offers are those of Epicu-
rus, which are yet preserved as his in Diogenes Laer-
tius. Lucretius muninus two opinions conegmjng
the moon, which were advanced by different philo-so—
phers in his own era, thc one, that the light she-dis-
penses is intrinsim and her own ς the other, that *it is
foreign, and (υἱ-«ΝΥ borrowed from the sun. He mo-
destly sorbeat-s to decide on either ofthem‚ though in
the prosecution of the poem he seems more inclined

licfamong the Greek and Roman sagea. Diogenes
Laertius asserta it to have been that of Anaximander,
who affirmed‚ says he, ii. 1. την τε omnim ψευδοφανῆ,
και απο ἠλιου φωτιζεσθαι : ‘⁸ that the moon shone With
spurious light, and was illuminated from the sun.”
Such too was the belief of Cicero and Macrobius:
and coasistently herewith are the following verses of
Catullus ad Dianam xxx³v. 15.

Tu potens Trivia, et notho es
Dicta lumine Luna.
