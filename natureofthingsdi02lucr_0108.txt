DE RERUM NATURA.

Id quibus ut fiat rebus cognoscere possiS,

Principio meminisse decet, quae diximus ante,

Semina multimodis in rebus mixta teneri.

Porro, omnes, quaequomque cibum capiunt, animantes,

Ut sunt dissimiles extrinsecus,

et generatim 65 o-

Extima membrorum circumcaesura coercet;

Proinde et seminibus constant,

variantque figura.

Semina quom porro distent, differre necesse est

Intervalla, viasque, foramina quae perhibemus,

Omnibus in membris, et in ore, ipsoque palam.

genus tetrao of Linn6us are extremely fond of it as
food ε and that so extensive a mortality was produced
in Philadelphia, in the years 1790 and 1791‚amongst
those who banquetted on the tetrae cupido, or
common pheasant of the country, in whose crop the
leaves and buds of the kalmia latifolia were occasion-
ally detected, that the mayor of this city thought it
his duty, by a public proclamation‚ to cantion the
peoplc against eating the pheasant.

Every created substance, therefore, possesses the
basis of a nutriment for some order of animals or
othcr3 and all that seems necessary, with respect
to those generally esteerned the most poisonous, is a

peculi-ar power in the stomach to select the parts
that are nutritious from those that are baneful, and

to secrete these alone into the system. The stomach
of different animals are, for this purpose, formed
with a vast diversity both of strength and structure.
Some, like those of horses, sheep, oxen, dogs, man,
and multitudes besides, are purely membranous3
others, like those of the crow and the heron, are a
combination of membran« and muscle 3 while a third
nort, as the stomach of fowls, turkeys, ducks, and
geese, is a firm and compact muscle alone; and is
generally denominated a gizzard. In these different

orders of stomaehs, their mechanical force, and the
gatsric juice secreted from them, and which af-
for-ds, in every instance, perhap8, a stronger sol-
vent than any other fluid we are acquainted with,
must both differ extremely. By a variety of accu—
rate experiments made a few years ago by Dr. Ste-
vens of Edinburgh, it appears, that gastric fluid
in the stomach of dogs is capable of dissolving the
hardest kind of animal substance that can be intro-
duced into it, even the most rigid bones and balls of
ivory ; while, in equal time, very little impression is
made upon potatoes, parsnip, and other vegetable
substances. In ruminating animals, on the con-
trary, as sheep and oxen, the gastric juice speedily
dissolves these latter, and all other kinds of vegeta-
bles, but makes no impression on even the sostest
kinds of animal foods, as flesh or fish. As the gas·
tric juicc of the human stomachis capable of dis-
solving‚ with nearly equal ease, both anirnals and ve-
getables, it has been rationally concluded, that na-
ture originally intended mankind to seed upon both
foods promiscuously.

The stror gest stomach we are acquainted with is
that of the tui-key3 and Reaumur and Spalanzani
