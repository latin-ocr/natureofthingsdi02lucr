In this passage, as in Lucretius himself, who has
judicious ly follou ed the popular mythology, these
·arious labours are attributed to one and the same
Hercules. But it is suspec cted, and perhaps justly,
by many critics, that they were the result of several
different personages of the same name, au of whom
acquired the appellation of Hercules, from the pos-
session of a degree of muscular strength, connected
with intrepidity of mind, far superior to those of
their contemporaries. The term Hercules, Ur-Cal-Es,
“ an ascending flame of fire,” proves obviously its
origin to be Chaldaic: and from the simple interpre-
tation of the name alone, Mr. Allwood, who trans-
lates it, in some measure, different, (“ an eminence
dedicated to the effulgence of ᾗτε-β’) notonlydenies th re
existence ofany ancient hero who individually personi-
fied this multiform character, but strenuously con-
tendS, that the vigorous and gigantic figure referred
to, as the Egyptian deity of this name, was merely
a mountain or temple dedicned to solar worship.
Yet nothing can be more inconclusive, or more ca-
pable of betraying us into infinite err-ors, even in real
history, than a literal adherence to the interpretation
of names, in judging os the characters ofthe persons
or things on whom they were conferred: and upon
the very same ground, l would undertake to prove,
that neither Adam, Cain, or Abel, had possessed a
real existence, their names being compounds of facts
or events which bear no relation to their own per·

sonal entity. By pursuing a similar plan, Mr- Bry-
ant, as 1 have already obmrved, has decided, that
there never was such a place as Troy, nor such he-
roes as Homer has >described in his epic poems. ΒΥ
the present theory, Mr'. Allwodd has blotted out of
the book of existence, all the fabulous gods, god—
desses, and heroes of India, Egypt, and Greece 5—-
and were the same hypothesis to be rigidly persevered
in, almost every man, of every possible description,
excepting our own contemporaries, who are capable
of speaking for themselves, might be cancelled from
the page of genuine biography, and simply regarded

as an ideal, assegoric, or hieroglyphic character. 1 Ι
am compelle d, therefore, to admit the existence of ὲ

some very ancient and celebrated hero of this deno-

mination ; and the principle I collect from his name ἶ

is, that his family, who gave it him, and doubtless
himself also, were attached to solar worship. Hc

was probably possessed os vast muscular strength, as ³
well as undaunted courage: whence his name has -

been proverbially applied, through every successive
age, to the possessor of the same qualities3 in con-

sequence of which, it is not improbable that, in ἷ

many instances, the exploits of his cognominals or
descendants have been attributed to himself. He
