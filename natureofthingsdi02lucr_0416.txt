Quod fuit in pretio, fit nullo denique honore;

Porro aliud subcedit, et e contemptibus exit,

Inque (lies magis adpetitur, floretque repertum

Et lapides, et item, sylvarum fragmina, ramei3

Et, flamma atque ignes post quarn sunt cognita primum,

Posterius ferri vis est, aerisque, reperta.

Et prior aeris erat, quam ferri, cognitus usus;

closely copied by Venusinus :

Mutum et turpe pecu5‚ glandem atque cubilia

Unguibus et pugnis, dein fustibus, atque ita porro
Pugnabant armis, quae post fabricaverat usus.

With nails and fists first fought they 3-——next with

The observatione of our poet, upon the comparative
proportion of native metals, are, as l have already ob-
served, surprisingly accurate, and in unison with the
dictates of modern chemistry. To the remarks,
however, 1 havejust offered iu the Note on ver. 1304,
1 will add here the following, from Mr. Kirwan's
Geological Essays, p. 401. “ Of all metals, gold is
most frequently found natlve. According to Berg-
man, it is more universally diffused than any other
metal‚ except iron : this may be a consequence of its
great divisibility and want of affinity to other sub-
stances, as oxygen, sulphurs, &c. Silver, in propor-
tion to the quantity of it that exists, (he is speaking
of native silver, p. 403.) is much more seldom found
than gold, by reason of its affinity to sulphur: it was
deposited in the same manner as gold, and its crys-
tallization proves it was once in a dissolved state.—
p. 404. In proportion to the quantity of copper in
other states, native copper is still rather scarcer than
