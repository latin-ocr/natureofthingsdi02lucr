THE NATURE OF THINGS.

323

Yet may the moon with lustre all her own

Shine, every phase unfolding, if, in front,

Some other orb attend her, through her course

735

Gliding complete, in every mode convolv'd‚

While viewless still to sight since rear’d opake.

Or she may still, if spherical of form,

Each change disclose, though luminous but half:

For, as she self-revolves, her gradual lamp

740

Must grow till all her bright side beams complete3

Theu, rolling still, as gradual must she close

Her lucid eye, till all oppos’d is shade3

As teach CHALDEAN magi, striving strong

The schools of GREECE t’ o'erpow’r‚ as though the creeds 745

menta of this half of her orb. The opinion here ad-
vanced, that the moon may probably be naturally lu-
minous in the hemisphere opposed to the earth, and
naturally opake in her antagonist side, wan strenu-
ously maintained by Berosus, a celebrated Chaldaic
astrologer in the aera of Antiochus Soter, and was
also the universal dogma of the Babylonian magi, in
opposition to the general philosophy of Cre-ece,
which asserted that the moon was uniformly opake of
herself in both hemispheres, aud that the light she
exhibited was borrowed entirely from the sun. The
Babyloniam, as is well observed by Faber in a cita-
tion from Plutarch, accounted for the eclipse os the
moon by supposing that at such time she turned
the unenlightened side of her orb towards the
earth, whence such a phaenomcnon would necessarily
enaue.

The passage in our poet herc referred to, has,
however, been in some measure differently understood

by some interpreters, who have idly apprehendcd
that he meaned to represent the Chaldaic and Baby-
lonian astronomers as two distinct secte, and that the
former united with the Greeks in opposition to the
latter. Marchetti has, unaccountably, adopted this
idea:

in quella stessa

Guisa‚ che i Bubilonici dottori,

 

Ι 03Ιάιί confutando, in contro all' arte
Degli astrologi lor tentar provere.

And thus also Creech:
And this the later Babylonian sect

Asserts, and the Chaldean schcmcs raject.

lt will be sufficient to insert the ῑικιζ to consum

this interpretation, ver. 726.

Ut Babylonica Chaldaesim doctrina. refutans
Astrologorum artem. contin convincere tendit.
