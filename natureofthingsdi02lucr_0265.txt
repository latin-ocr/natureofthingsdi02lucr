Boox V. THE NATURE OF TIIINGS. ,⁶2:31

VVhence chief the world is rear'd‚ of frames consist 2 50
Create and mortal‚ mortal and create
Must, too, the total world itself be deem'd.
For where we see the separate parts of things
Of figures form'd, now rising, now destroy'd‚
There see we, too, the mass those parts compose 2 5 5
Must have alike an origin and end.
So, where we view the world's chief members rise,
And waste alternate, heaven and earth we hold
Erst was created and must soon decay.

Moisture or hear, are perishable all;
Reviving still, and urg‘d to grou-th mature.
For much of earth perpetual suns to dust
Burn most impalpable3 and much the tread 26 5
Of ceaseless traffie into clouds compels,
Blown by the winds o'er all the void of heaven.
While part, if glebe, the rushing rains dissolve,
Or restless tides, if form'd of bank abrupt.
