DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. V.

Ut non sit mirum si in taleis disposituras

Deciderunt quoque, et in taleis venere meatus,

Qualibus haec rerum geritur nunc summa novando.¹

Quod, si jam rerum ignorem primordia quae sint,

Hoc tamen ex ipsis coeli rationibus ausim

Confirmare, aliisque ex rebus reddere multis3

Nequaquam nobis divinitus esse paratam

Naturam rerum3 tant-51 stat praedita culpa.

Principio, quantum coeli tegit inpetus ingens,

Inde avidam partem monteS, sylvaeque ferarum,

Possedere ; tenent rupeS‚ vastaeque paludes,

Et mare, quod late terrarum distinet oras,

Ver. 2c5. E'm though the r1'se osthings I ne'er could

proves] This, and the three succeeding verses,

arc repeated from Book ΙΙ. 182, and follou·ing; to

which, and the annotation that acconipanies them, I
refer the reader, it' he wish for explanation.

'Ehe existence of moral and physical evil, upon the
consideration of which our poet is now enteriug, is a
difficulty ofimmeusc magnitude upon every system.
lf matter, as to its <ssence‚ were created by the Deity
from nothing, why was it not created exempt from
the evils it is perpetually exhibiting? Or, if this be
impossible from the nature of matter itself, why was
not some other substance, or mode of being, selected
in preference to matter, and devoid of its imperfec-
tions Ξ Indepcndcntly, therefore, of the difficulty
which is pretended to be attached to the idea that any
thing can spring from nothing, it is not improbable
that Epicurus, as well as many other Grecian philoso-
pherS, were also influenced by such additional consi·
derations, in contending that matter was eternal: in
doing which, they also necessarily admitted that the

Deity himself could not abrogate the defects to
which it is inherently subject: and of course is not
accountable for the evils it evinces. Of these evils our
poetis now procecding to point out a variety, and
consecutively to demonstrate the truth ofthe Epicurean
doctrine, that the material basis or substratum is not
ofdivine origin ; in the words of the poem itself, that

No power divine this mass material rear'd.

Polignac has noticed the present passage and much
that follows, at full length, and with a view of answer-

ing the objections advanced. The imitation, which
is obviem, commences at lib. ix. 510.

Si bonus est Deus, omnipotens si cuncta gu-
bemat‚&c.

The whole passage is too long to be copie-d ς and
the reply, which it is designed to offer, is b) no means

satisfactory, though generally plausible and ingenious,
The author himself, indeed, is, not perfectly contented

with his own arguments, and hence concludes with re-
ferring us, for ampler information‚to a state of futurity.
