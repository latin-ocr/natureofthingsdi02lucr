DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. IV.

Multa minuta, jaci quae possint ordine eorum,

Quo fuerint, et forma‘i servare figuram ;

Et multo citius quanto minus indupediri

Pauca queunt, et sunt in prim& fronte locata.

Nam certe jacere, ac perciti, multa videmus3

Non solum ex alto penitusque, ut diximus ante,

Verum de summis ipsum quoque saepe colore-m:

Et volgo faciunt id lutea russaque vela,

Et ferrugina, quom, magnis intenta theatris,

Per malos volgata trabesque, trementia fluctant. 7

Namque ibi concessum cavea'i subter, et ornnem

Scenalem speciem, patrum, matrumque, deorumque,

Inficiunt, coguntque suo fluitare colore τ

Et ferrugina,

No metal‚txcepting copper,exhibits, in its cherni-

cal combinations with different subsanam, such a di-

versity of hues as iron. But the colour here mani-

festly alluded to, is the beautiful violet of bui-nt and

polished steel. On this account, virgil has bestowed
the same epithet on the hyacinth :

 

et ferrugineos hyacinthos. Crono. ii. 4.

With the Mantuan bard, indeed, it appears to
have been a favouritc term; it occurs repeatedly in
the AEneid 3 and in Georg. i. 467. he employs it to
txplain the bloody purple in which the sun exhibited
himself when he deplored the sall os Caesar:

νω--ικιςηιῖ obscura nitidum ferrugine texit.

 

in iron clouds hc veiled his light.

1 give the translation of ΜΓ. Soffieby, which, in
the present instance, does not appear to possess his
usual accnracy and fclicity: for I much question
whether the term iron, in the nse before us, be calcu-
lated to convcy to the English reader the idea of the
Roman hard as relating to colour rather than to
harshness οι· severity of substance. The verse in the
original, moreover, as it appears to me, is meant to
describe the sun as labouring under an eclipse, as
cloathcd in a ‘⁴ bloody iron hue,” as it might
faithfully be translated, iather than as veiled by
clouds of a fcrruginous tinctnre. Certainly, no such
term as clouds occurs in the Latin text.
