DE RERUM NATURA.

Nam dubium uon est, animai quin opera sit

Sensus hic in nobis; quem quom sopor inpedit esse,

Tum nobis animam perturbatam esse putandum est,‘

and gentle in their degree of action ; and that hence
they equally, also, continue without exhausting us,
except when unduly rouscd; aud form a habit too
pertinacicus and invincible to be broken through by
any exertions whatever.

Thought iS, then, to the brain that which the
muscular habits, I have just spoken of, are to the
muscles which are the subjects of them. Both con-
tinue alike, whether we be reflectiug upon the ac-
tion, oi· whether we be not: but the habit of think-
ing is so much older, and consequently‚ so much
deeper rooted than that of any kind of gesticulation,
that, as I have just observ-cd, it is impossible for us
to break through itby the utmost efforts of the will :
whence it accompanics us, excepting when the brain
is totally exhaustcd‚ and, consequently. thrown into
a profouud torpidity οι· sleep, not only at all times
when awake, but almost at all times during sle-ep,
aud is the immediate and necessary cause of our
DREAMING.

[11. Thought can only be exercised upon objects
introduced into the hrain, or general sensorium‚ by
the organs ‹›f externa] sensation : and hence the berit
or chief direction of our thoughts, whether sleepiug
or waking, must bc derived from those objects which
principally impress us, be the causes of such impres-
sion what they may. The tmin of thoughts, then,
which recurs from habit alone, asin sleep‚ or total
retirement from ihc world, must generally be of this
description ·‚ in the sorinsr case, however, by no
means correctly or perft·ctl>⁴‚ because there are others,
also, which have a tendency to recizr, and neither the
will nor the senses are in action to repi‘ess thern:
whence proceeds a combirntion us thoughts or ideas,

sometimes in a small degree incongruens, and, at other
times, most wild and heterogeneous; occasbnally,
indeed, so fearful and extravagant as to stimulate the
senses themselves into a sudden renewal of their
functions, and consequendy, to break off abruptly
the sleep into which they were thrown.

IV. If the action of the nervous tubules of the
hrain. thus continued from habit, and producing our
dreams, be less powerful during sleep than is suffi-
cient to rouse the senscs generalijae, it may, neverthe·
less, at times, be power-ful enough to excite, into
their accustomed exercise, the muscles of those organs
οι· members which are more immediately connected
with the train of our dreams, or incoherent thoughts,
while, nevenhekss, every other organ or member
still remains torpid. Hence some persons talk, and
others walk in their sleep, without being apprized,
on their waking, of any such occurrence.

V. whatever be the set of nerves that have chiefly
become exhausted from the labour oi* stimulus of the
day, the lest, as Ι have already noticed, partake of
the same torpidity from long habit of azsoc³ation5
exhauste& in some degree, alst), themselves, by the
portion of sensoria! power which, aa from a common
stock, they have contribut'ed towards the support of
the debilitated orgari. But it sometimes happens,
either from disease, 01· peculiarity of constitution,
[hat all the external organs of sense do not associate
in their actions, or yield alike to the general torpi-
dity of the frame: and that the auditory, the op-
tical, or some other set of neri-es are in vigour,
while all the other nei-ves of the exten-nal scnses re-
main torpid ι as it may do also, that an entire organ
