Hear thou attentive, and with mind acute,

Lest aught appear incongruouS, and thy breast

Recoil abhorrent from the truths we teach‚

Foe to the creed from ignorance alone.

Sleep, then, occurs when fades through every limb

The soul's sensorial power, part by fatigue

for the purpose of compressing it into a single Note
with as much conciseness as possible.

1. All the fibi-ils of the nervons system become fa-
tigued, exhausted, and torpid, in proper-tion to the
length and violence of their exertion, and recover-
their power alone by rest. The weariness and debi-
lity of the muscles of the arms or legs, after extreme
exercise, or exer-eise to which they have not been ac-
customed‚ may be adduced as a sufficient proof of
this position. The nervous fibrils of the external or-
gans of sense are necessarily subject to the same ef-
fect: we neither hear, nor see, nor taste‚ nor feel,
with the same accuracy, after any or all these various
organa have been long upon the full strctch of action,
with which we do on their first exertion in the morn-
ing. Increase, or prolongate their aetion, and their
power will be still fai-ther obtunded, till, at length,
like an over-wearied limb‚ they become persectly le-
thargic, and give no account ofwhatever is occurring
around us; and it is this uniform lethargy, torpirlityu
or inaction of all the external senses, which we deno-
minate SLEEP. By the exercise of the will, or any
other strong stimulus, this sleep, or sensoria} tm·-
pidity, may be postponed: and vice ver-sd, by the
consent of the u ill, it may be expedited.

Il. The vital organa are far less subject to the in-
fluence of stinmlants of every kind, than the organs
uf externa] stnse: their actions arc hawt- snr more
equahle and permanent 3 ιΙιιὟ are sddom w wir-„i or

torpid. From the application of very strong stimu-
lant-⁰», however, whether external, as those of severe
pain or labour, or internnl, as those of disease, or
excessive grief, such fatigue or exhaustinn actually
takes place; and when the exhaustion is complete,
they also, like the organs of external sense, slecp, or
become torpid :—in other words, death ensues, and
the spirit separat& from the body. The resemblance
between death and sltep, therefore, is not less correct,
upon the principles of physiology, than it is beauti-
sul among the images of poetry. Sleep is the a'mth
or torpidily of the organs of external sense, while th:
vital functions continue ‘their accustomed actions:
death is the sleep or torpidity of the whole.

III. Every orgari of the animal frame recovem
from its fatigue or torpidity by rest, provided the
principle of life, that is to say, the aetion of the
vital organs, continues. Hence, the orgnns of exter-
nal sense, ina definite period of time, and a period
generally proportione-d to the degree of their ex-
haustum, re-acqnire their accustomed vigour. are
alive to the influence os their appropriate stimulatus,
and the smziilcst excita-nient applied to any one of
them, thrmvs the whole once more into aetion: in
other words, theman awakcs srom Jleep. he roua&
