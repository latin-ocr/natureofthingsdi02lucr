DE RERUM NATURA.

Ltn. IV.

Desidiose agere aetatem, lustrisque perire;

Aut quod in ambiguo verbum jaculata reliquit;

1130

Quod, cupido adfixum cordi, vivescit, ut ignis ε

Aut nimium jactare oculos, aliumve tueri,

Quod putat3 in voltuque videt vestigia fissis·

Atque in amore male haee proprio, summeque secundo,

Inveniuntur: in advorso vero atque inopi sunt,

1135

prehendere quae possiS‚ oculorum lumine operto,

Innumerabilia: ut melius vigilare sit, ante

Bai endless bitters there lie hid
As thorns the roses’ blooms amid-

So, and more emphatically still, Deut. xxxii. 32.
Their grapes are the grapes of gall :
Their clusters are deadly bitterness :
The poison of dragous is their wine ;
Their pure wine the venem os asps.

This, and several preceding verses, are thus beauti-
fully imitated by Thomson ι

E'en present in the very lap of love

Inglorious laid, while music flows around,

Perfumes‚ and aiis, and wincs, and wanton hours ;

Amid the rores fierce Repemance rears

Her snaky erest: a quick-rcturning paug

Shoots through the consciens heort.

Ver. 1¹78. —soms phrase os doubtful import darm]
In the original, v. 1 130:

 

iu ambiguo verbumjaculala reliquit.

And thus Homer:
'04 τον >xxa-,erim mercam» εσχ’ αγοςοιω : IL. Β. 275.
who silenc'd soon this slander-darting wretch.

In the Proverbs, the same subject is brought for-
wards, and with wonderful similarity of imagery.
Thus, vii. 22, 23 ι

Headlong he followeth her,

As the ox goeth towards the shambles—
Till a dart strike through his lt‘ver.

The original is peculiarly expressive. The He-
brew verb Πῑῖῃ, here, and generally translated striks
through, means rather to plough through, or furrow
deepssy, αυλακιζειν. The Arabians still retain the saine
term, and ir. the same sense, effi, The liver was

equally supposed, by the Greeks, and Asiatics, to
be the immediate seat of appetite aud desire; and
the passage in Psalm xvi. 9. commonly translated,
‘⁴ my glory 1‘cj0icetl1,’' is, literally (7:12) “my
[ι’-οων rejoiceth;’' and would have been far better
Thus,

rendered ‘¹ my desire,’‘ than “my glory.‘’
Theocritus:

εχθιστον εχει, ὖποκοιρὲιον ελκος,
Kame,- M μεγαλα-,- τῦ ἰ, ‘HHATt ταξε βελεμογ.

In. Ψ. 15.
