Heat that pervades e'en steel‚

THE NATURE OF THINGS.

and through the helrn

Rushes, where rests it round the fretted neck.

So rusheS, too, contagion from without

Deep through each quiv’ring organ.

In heaven engender'd pierces earth profound3

The red storin

Or, if in earth it ripen, heaven above

Shakes with the shock through all its shattering walls.

For nought combines through nature void of poreS.

Then not unvarying in exterior shape

All atoms flow from all things; nor alike

On all things act they, with effect unchang'd.

The beam that burns and dries the moisten'd earth,

Fluxes the frost‚ o’er mountains pil’d sublime

Rolls, in loose tide, the macerated snows,

In all the common editions, we meet with the pas-
sage thus:
Et tempestates terri, coeloque coortxe
E calo (πων-ε, terraque repente facessunt.

This reading 1 do not pretend to understand, nor
do 1 find any interpreter who has been more fortu-
nate. Mr. Wakefield proposes as follows, and 1
have not chosen to demite-from his own reading in
the Latin text above, although I have given my own
lection in the version 2

Et temptantem, tcrrz‘x coeloque coortam
In coelum terramque remote jure facessunt.

And he explains the couplet thus: ¹¹ Philosophi
:nerito remittunt in terram coelumquc eam tempesta·
tem, qum de terra coeloquc primum est exorta.” i. f.
*¹ ln re dicunt tempestatem caeca corpora rnrvns in
immensitate spatii recepta condi, atque evanescere.”
“philosopher-s properly transfer again into the heavens
zind the carth the tempu-,vt which first originatcd in

the heavens and the earth.’' ‘⁸ Tliat is,” continues
he, “they justly assei-t, that the vicwless particlcs
that constitute tempests, are returned again into the
immensity of space, and thus vanish away.”

The alteration proposed by Faber is outrageoml)¹
wide, even when compared with the Florence copv,
which first suggested to him the idea. It occurs tim. ε

Nam tempesralcm [alo terrave scortum
V el serr} miliari! timet, circumque falisci!-

I leave the reader to dctcnminc for himself.
