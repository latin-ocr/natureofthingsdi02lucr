THE NATURE OF THINGS.

A plague like this, a tempest big with fate

Once ravag'd Armms, ancl her sad clomains:

Unpeopled all her city, and her paths

Swept with destruction.

For amid the realms

Begot of EGYPT, many a mighty tract

Of ether travers'd, many a flood o'erpast‚

At length, here fix’d it; o’er the hapless realm

Of CECROPS hovering‚ and th' astonish’d race

Dooming by thousands to disease and death.

sudden.”
The same deleterious quarter has been equally ac-

cused of producing the same evil in modern times.
Thus, Thomson :

From Ethiopia’s poisoned woods,

From stiffled Cairo’s filth, and fetid fields‚

With locust-armies putrefying heap’d,

This great destroyer sprung.

 

Summm, 1055.

The description here given us by Lucretius has been
srcely employed by Sebastian Erant, in his Ehgiuw,
as he strangely calls it, de Pestilentia Scorra, sive lm-
petigine anni xcvi, which was, unqilestionably‚ the
venere-al disease on its first introduction into Europe
upon the return of Columbus from Hispaniola. The
Poem forms a part of his Varia Carmina, Baslc‚
μιᾳ-ἶ. And the verses immediately before us arc
ihus imitated:

Pestiferum in Ligures transvexit Francia morbum
Qiem mala tle Franzos romula lingua vocat.

Hie Latium atque Italos invasit ; ab Alpibus extra
Serpens, Germanos Istricolasque premit, &c-

France to Liguria bore the bane funest

U'htnce by the vulgar tcrrn’d thr Gallie pest :

'if-1 Rome thence winds it, :ind th' Italian shores,

Climbs the stecp Alps, and witlc o'er Austiia

Ver. 1183. At lcngth, her-estv’d il ‚· ] Among
the imitators of this description os the Athenian pes—
tilence, is Dr. Spratt, bishop of Rochcster. fiis
Poem, which is long and tedious, consista of what
he calls, a Pindaric Ode, but which exhibita nothing
of the genius os Pindar in its composition. It is an
irregular dithyrambic, filled with absurdities and con-
ceits. Creech, unhappily, appears to have approved
it, and has hence, not unfrequently, copied from
it, in his version of this part of Lucretius. Without
meaning to take any further notice, either of Spu-att,
or the occasional verses sor which Creech is indtbted
to him, I shall only mention that, as an appendix to
the verse now before υς, the latter has added a coup-
let from the forme-r, of which Lucretius nex-cr fur.

The wind that bore the sate went slowly on,

And, as it went, was heard to sigh and gronii.
