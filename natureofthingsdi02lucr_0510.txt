DE RERUM NATURA.

Lr Β. VI.

Usque adeo, donec tempestas sceva coorta est.

Fit quoque, utei montis vicina cacumina coelo

Quam sint quoique magis, tauto magis edita fument

Adsidue fulvae nubis caligine crassfi‘:

460

Propterea, quia, quom consistunt nubila primum,

Ante videre oculei quam possint tenuia, ventei

Portantes cogunt ad summa cacumina montis.

Heic demum fit, urei, turba majore coortu,

Et condensa atque arta adparere, et simul ipso

465

Vortiee de montis videatur surgere in aethram.

Nam loca declarat sursum ventosa patere

Res ipsa, et sensum, monteis quom adscendirnus altos. ⁵

Praeterea, permulta mari quoque tollere toto

Corpora naturam, declarant litore vestes

470

Subspensae, quom concipiunt humoris adhaesum.

Ver. 474. ‘Till broad o'er ether srowns thefnish'd
sturm] The whole passage is thus imitated by
Thomson ε

At first a dusky wreath they seem to rise,
Scarce staining ether; but by swift degi-ees,
In heaps on heaps‚ the doubling vapour sails
Along the loaded sky, and mingliug deep,
Sits on th‘ horizon round, a settled gloom.

’ Semne, 146.

Ver. 476. In lide perpetual smol-e the yellow steams]
To this delineation of our poet, also, we catch Thom-
son turning an occasional glauce :

 

a yellow mist
Far smoaking o’er th' interminable plain.
Seniue, 193.

Ver. 478. the winnowing wind

Here, in hage masscs, palpable to view,] The

 

observation of Lucretius, that vapours collect prin-
cipaliy, and are most largely exhaled into the at-
mosphere from the summitas of lofty mountains, is con-
sistent with daily fact 3 and the reason he here offers
for their more frequent existence iu these stations, is
equally-ingeniousnnd pluilosophical. This, however,
is not the only reason: in the publication, entitled
“ Description des quelques Appareils nouveaux, ou
pei'fectionnes de la Fondation Teylerienne, l'an
1798,'' Van Marum lias evinced, by an easy pro-
ceSS‚ how easily water conver-ts into vapour, by
removing the pressure of the atmosphere; audon thia
account also, he justly concludes, that more must as·
cend, in a given space of surface, from the sum-
mit οἱ mountains‚ than from either vallies or plaina-
The same fact is thus additionally confirmed by
Mr. Kirwan, in his Geological EssayS‚ No. 2.
