Boox VI. THE NATURE OF THINGS. 471

With fire surchargfl, and fierce fermenting air, 265
Driving appall'd each mortal to his home.

XVhence high through ether must the tempest reae-h,

Pil'd cloud o'er cloud, the. sun obstructing deep,

Or ne’er such ten—fold darkness could be rear'd‚

Nor rush those headlong torrents that o'erpower 270
Oft every stream, and drown the cultur’d plains.

These all with fires, with furious airs are filffl,
VVhence spring the flash, and repercussive roas.
For, as we erst have sung, full many a seed

And with their fury its own rage combin’d,
Then springs the fiery vortex, and within 280
Forges profound‚ and points its deadly dartS,
