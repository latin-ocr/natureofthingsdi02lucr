DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. VI.

Insinuarit, et hinc dominatus ut extulerit se.

Quorum operum caussas nulla ratione videre ·

Possunt, ac fieri divino numine rentur.

Tu mihi, supremae praescripta ad candida callis

Currenti, spatium praemonstra, callida Musa,

Calliope! requies hominum, divomque voluptas:

Te duce, ut insigni capiam cum laude coronam.

Principio, tonitru quatiuntur caerula coeli,

Ver. 92. And, doubtful whence it springs, with head-

Iong haste] This, and the ensuing verse, by

the use of our poet’s favour-ite figure, the periodic

iteration, are repeated, with a trifling change, from
ver. 58, 59. of the Book before us.

Ver. 95. estnon! O, aidme as Itread
Now the last limits ] Thus imitated by
Camoens‚ towards the conclusion of his Lusiad :

 

Aqui minha Caliope te invoco

Neste trabalho extremo, porque em pago

Me tornes, do que seres-0, e em vao pre-tendo

O gosto d’ escrever‚ que νου perdendo, ἂς.
CAN-r. x.

And thou, my Muse ! O fairest of the train,

Cnuovs, inspire my closing strain.

No more the summer of my life remains,

My autumn's length’ning evenings chill my veins;

Down the blcak stream of years, by woes on woes

WVing'd on, I hasten to the tomb’s repose,

The port whose deep, dark bottom shall detain

My anchor, never to be weigh'd again 3

Never, on other sea of life to steer·

'The human-course-—Yet thou, Ο goddess ! hear.
Μιεκιε.

few poets, not writing upon a similar subject,
seem to have imitated Lucretius more freely than
Camoens, and, consequently‚ to have been more at-
tached to his style and his metaphors. As I have
omitted to notice it in its proper place, I shall here
briefly observe, that the comparison of the medicinal

95

potion‚ and the hesitation of the sick person in swal-
lowing it, on account of its unpalatable taste, intro-
duced into the present Poem, Book Ι. 999, and
Book IV. 10—a passage closely copied, both by

Tasso and Spenser—eis thus more closely imitated by·-
Camoens ι

Em varios pensamentos se derrama: v
Fantasiando esta remedio certo,
Que desse a quanto mal se lhe ordonava.
Tudo temia, tudo em firn cuidava.

Lus. viii. 86.
Yet as tbe sick man loaths the bitter draught‚
Though rich with health, he knows the cup comes

fraught ;

His heahh, without it, self-deceiv'd, he weighs,
Now hastes to quaff the drug, and now delays 3
Reluctant thus, as wavering passion veer’d,
The Indian Lord the dauntless Gama heard. ι

Μιςκιε.
In like manner, the general feeling os voluptuous-

ness and love, which the approach of Venus inspires “

through every class of the animated world, so exqui-
sitely delineated in the opening of the first Book of
the present Poem, is imitated with the utmost taste

and elegance in the ninth Canto of the Lusiad, stan-
zas 67-08.

Algurn que em espingardas e nas bestas

Pera ferir os cervos se flavam, Sec.
