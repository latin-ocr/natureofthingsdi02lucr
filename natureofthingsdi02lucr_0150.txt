DE RERU M NATURA.

Lm. lv.

Clamor, in aetheriis disparsus nubibus austri.

Tu mihi da tenueis aureis, animumque sagacem:

910

Ne fieri negites, quse dicam, posse ; retroque

Vera repulsanti discedas pectore dicta:

Tutemet in culp-51 quom sis, neque cernere possis.

Principio, somnus fit, ubi est distracta per artus

Vis animae3 partimque foras ejecta recessit,

 

Ver. Ἰ).9. as the swan's Ione dirge

Flows forth superior to the clamorous croak]
We have here another proof of oui-poct's attachment
to what 1 have before denominated the periodic itera-
tion. See Note on v. ι . of this Book. These two verses,
with two more immediately attached to them, are
repeated from Book IV. v. 185. They may, with-
out transgression, be compared with the following

meritorious, and truly musical verses of Beattie z

Thongh rich-est hues the peacock’s plumes adorn,
Yet horror screams froin his discordant throat.
Rise, sons of harmony ! and hail the morn,
While warbling larks on russet pinions float.
Missa-nat, i. 5.

Ver. 9¹36. Sleep‚ then, occurs uvhcn fades through
every· limb

The· soul’s sensorial powers ] Our poet

now proceeds to the philosophy of sleep, and it is

 

inpossible to periise the theory he advances without
meaning strongly to mind the system lately offered
by Dr. Darwin. The connexion is truly astonish-
ing 2 and although Ι dare not ass-ert that the doctor
derived liis own immediately from the writings of Lu—
cretius, yet if he did not, the connexion is more as-
tonishing still. To dwell upon it would be nearly
to repeat in prose, what the text gives ns in poetry:
and how closely this latter coincides with the opinion
of Epicurus himself, may be collected from the fol-
lowing passage contained in one os his letters yet

extant, as preserved by . „w Laertius: 'ru-roc το

The different opinions of the other Grecian phi-
losopher-s are scarcely worth recording: they ane,
npon the whole, equally puerile and unsatisfactory.
Yet, perhaps, the moderns have not been much more
successful. At the theory advanced by Dr. Darwin,
1 have already glanced: it betrays the source from
which it was either directly or indirectly derived3
yet, with all its additions, it is still unsatisfactory,
and has little prospect of remote or extensive fame.
Leibnitz, wolfe, Locke‚ Berkley, and Beattie, are
the chief physiologists‚ independently of Darwin,
who have ventur-ed to advance systems upon this de·
licate subject, in modern times: and of these, all
are falling, or have nearly fallen already into the
gulph of oblivion. That of Berkley is by far the
most consistent, and best worthy of preservation ε
yet, the very rudiments on which it reposca, as 1
have previously had occasion to observe in Note on
ver. 766. of the present Book, are in direct hosti-
lity with the best ascertained experimenta-of Gal>-
vanism, as directed to the human body3 and even
Berkley himself did not undertake to solve, upon
this hypothesis, a variety of the phaenomena that τε·
late both to sleep and dreaming.

Such being the fact, I shall take the liberty of
submitting to the reader’s candid attention the sol-
lowing outlines of a theory of my own, drawn up
