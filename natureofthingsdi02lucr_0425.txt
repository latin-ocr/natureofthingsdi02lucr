THE NATURE oF THJNGS.

411

Amid the various worlds through space that throng,

To leave their seat uncertain, than tow'rds earth

1380

Specific point, or aught of world besides.

Yet must they, doubtless, have been wag'd from hope

Far less of conquest than revenge‚ each host

Unarrn'd, unmarshall'd, and of death assur'd.

The rude-stitch'd hide preceded the wovc. vest,

Ῑ385

Plann’d after iton, and with ison wrought:

For without this the loom had ne'cr been fram'd,

Its shuttles, treadles, sley, and creaking beam.

Yet men first us'd the distaff, and the whecl,

Ere learan the female race3 since males throughout

1290

Prove prompter far, more dextrous, and expett ;

Till the rough swain, at length, such labours mock'd

As sole the woman's province, sterner toils

The man's rude strength demanding, hardier arts

Your hardy labours : let the sounding loom

Mix with the melody of every vale ;

The loom, that long-renown’d, wide-cnvicd gift
Of wealthy Flandria, who the boon receiv‘d
From fair Venetia ς she from Grecian nyxnphs ς
They from Phenice, who obtained the dole
From old AEgyptuS. Fures, iii.
