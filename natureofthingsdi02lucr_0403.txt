3001< v. THE NATURE oF THINGS. sein·

Unvarying form, the phantoms ever rose, 1 200
(As rise they must); and o’er such massy strength

No power, they deem’d, could triumph. Blest supreme
Then, too, they held them, since the dread of death

Such ne’er could haunt, and deeds stupendous oft

Seem’d they, in dreams, with utmost ease t' achieve. 1 205

Each various phase, moreo'er‚ the heavens disclose‚
Each various season, punctual to its hour
They mark'd incessant3 and, the cause unknown,
These to the gods, with subterfuge most prompt,
Nodding omnific, idly they referr'd. r 210
And in the heavens their blest abodes they plaic'd,
Their awful temples, since both sun and moon
Here radiant reign ; sun, moon, and day, and night,
And night’s dread fires, and meteors wand'ring wild,
And swift-plum’d lightnings‚ showers, and crystal deus, 1 2¹5
Clouds, snows, winds, tlmnders, hail, and countless storius,
Through ether threatning with tremendous soar.
O hapless mortals! that could first ascribe

Such facts, such furies to th' immortal gods.
