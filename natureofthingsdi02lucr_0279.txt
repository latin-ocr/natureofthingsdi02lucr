THE NATURE OF THINGS.

265

W hence fell each chief unhonour'd? and his dee&

Shut from the tablet of immortal fame ?

But, οι· Ι err, the world’s vast scope exists

New from its nature, and of recent birth:

For many a liberal art now first unfolds‚

345

And much is still progressive3 genius much,

E'en at this bour, to navigation adds;

Nor minstrels long have struck the dulcet lyre:

While the vast science of the R1sE OF TmNGs

Throughout is novel; and, among the first,

350

I first am number'd who the lore devis’d,

And taught its dictates in our native tongue.

Yet should'st thou deem that all things erst ensu’d

As now, but that the sace of men unknown,

habet novitatem summa recensque

Natura mundi est ς neque pridem exordia cepit.
Ver. 331.

In the common editions, we meet with the latter
line thus:
Natura 'st mundi, neque pridem exordia cepit.

 

 

Ver. 3 50. mul, among lhc first,

I first am number'd who the lore devis‘d,] Mar-
chetti takes an opportunity, in this place, with a
most extraordinary kind os anachronism, of paying
a compliment bot’n to Gasscndi and himself. Little,
indeed. could Lucretius expect, at the time of writ-
ing this ‹imici-,that the names osa pont and a philoso-
pher, who were not to be born till nearly two thou-
sand years afterwards, would ever become ingrafted
intoixs teu even in the form os a translation ε

Questa stessa cagione, e questa stessa
ΝΑτυιΛ ntus coss, ancorch‘e molto
Sia. che gia fu trovam, omni del tutto
Quasi sepolta in sempiterno obblio

Pur di fresco ὲ rison-ta, e vie pisi vaga.

E pit] bella, clic mai, per lc immortali
Opre dcl gran GAssnsno, onore, e lume
Del bel paese, ove la Senna inonda.

Ed ιο pur or principalmentc, ιο sresso
Fui trovato fra tanti, ed ebbe in sorte
D’csporla altrui nella materna lingum

Pria d' ogni altro Toscan, come dcttullzi
Per cntro α’ dotti suoi carmi robusti

Pria d'ogni altro Romano il gran Lucretio.

E’en this sair system that the ΝΛτυειε opes
Or Tmucs created, long cre now disclos'd.
But since long bm-icd in oblivimus night.
At length more clinke, more lovely. froin its graue
Springs, by Gasscndicall‘d‚ whose name shall live
Th< boast sor ever of the banks of Scine ς
And I, 1 first of all tlic Tuscan racc
Uprose t’ unfold it in my native tongue,
As first Lucretius ιο the Roman state
Unlock'd its mystic truths in verse sublime.
