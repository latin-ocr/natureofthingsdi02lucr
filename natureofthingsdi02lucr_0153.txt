THE NATURE OF THINGS.

VVasted *through ether, and concenter'd part

Deep in each vital organ3 till, at length,

Lax grow the members, listleSS, and dissolv’d.

Hence the nostrils, not accustomed to snuff, are
more forcibly agitated by its application than those
that are θος the eyes of persons accustomed to sleep
in the glare of the sun, find no inconvenience from

exposure to the light of the morning3 while those¹

who always sleep in total darkness, are awolze by the
return of day-light. And so of the rest.

X. On this account, a very small portion oflight, of
eound, or of exercise, even the breath of t'ne air
alone, are each of them powerful stimulants upon in-
fants, because unaccustomed to them: hence they
sleep much, and soundly: so soundly‚ indeed, that no
common stimulus is able, for a long time, to arouse
them from their torpidity. In other words, it re-
quires a period of many hours for the external organs
to recover From their exhaustion. The smallest un-
dulatory motion in the uterus, and the very action of
the vital organa themselves are, perhapS, sufficient
to wear out, from time to time, the sensorial power
of the fetus on its first formation: and hence, the

fetus sleeps, with few intermissions, through the
whole period of parturition.

XI. For the same reason, persons in an advanced
age are far lessimpressed by common stimulants than
in any former period of their lives ε from a long series
of exposure to their operation, their organs are be-
come more torpid, and hence they require less slecp,
and, at the same time, less food. The vital organs,
as well as those of external sense, partake of the
same disposition. They are, in consequence, less
liable to all violent or inflammatory disordcrs: bnt
the general torpidity incrasing, the heart is stimu-
lated with great difficulty—a smallcr portion uf scn-
sorial power iu secreted from the gasses of the atmo-
sphere—:a smaller portion of food is thrown iuto the
system from thc emmach—the puhxe, and evcry other
power, §gradually declines. till, nt lenmh, if ever man
were to die of old age alone, he would die froin a
total torpidity or paralysis ofthe heart. But debili-

fore such a period ean ari-ive, the smine at large is
incapable of resisting the smallest of those trivi-al
shocks to which man is daily exposed, either interuzil
or externa] ; or, in other words, there is uo acunum-
lation of sensorial power to supply the temporary dt-
mand, and the inan dics from sudden eximustiou rd-
ther than from progressive paralysis.

Upon this theory I might easily and obxiously
solve a variety of problems which have hithmo clu-
ded all satisfactory explanation: bnt, ns Ι intend
to pursue the subject more fully, in a short tune.
and to present it before the public iu a different and
a detached form, 1 shall only add to this outline of the
theory of SLEEP, a few observationis upon that ol*
DREAMiNG, which is so intimately connected with it.
as wellin nature as in the Poem before us.

Ι. A certain bnt a very small degree of stimulus
applied, perhaps, to any ncrve whatever ofthe human
body, instead of exhausting it, seems to afford it
pleasure: or, at least, the nerve is able to endure it
without bccoming torpid, or, which is the same thing,
requiring sleep or rest. The orbicular motion ofthe
lips to an infant accustomed to suck, is a source ol
so much comfort, and attendcd with so little ex-
haustion‚ that, whether sleeping or waking, it will
generally be found mimickiug the act of suckmg.
when at a distance from its nurse, aud perhaps not
thinking of such action itsclf. A person who, from
habit, has acquir-ed a particular motion of any one of
his limbs, a tuirl os the liugcrs, or a swingiog of one
leg over the other, perseveres in such motion from
habit alone. aud fet-15 no torpidity or exhaustion iu
the nerves that arc exciti-d, although it might bc iu-
tolcrahly fatigiiiug to another who hasncvcr acquir-cd
the same custnnn

ll. lt is probuble, that both thought, and stc
action os the vital orgnns, are stimulatus os this pre.
eise character, if not iu their cotumtnctmcnt. :it
lens-t, very shortly afttrwardsz that nearly, is not al.
tog-uhtu frum the first. they are equally plens-[urg
