DE RERUM NATURA,

Lm. IV.

Nigra μελιχροος est3 inmunda ac fetida, ακοσμος·

Caesia, Παλλαδιον· nervosa et lignea, Δορκας·

Parvola pumilio, Χαριτων fua, tota merum sal;

Magna atque inmanis, καταπληξις, plenaque honoris:

Balba, loqui nou quit? τραυλιζει· muta, pudens est;

At flagrans, odiosa, loquacula, Λαμπαὸιον fit:

Ισχνον ερωμενιον tum fit, quom vivere non quit

Prae macie3 ῥαδινη vero est, jam mortua tussi :

At gemina et mammosa, Ceres est ipsa ab laccho :

The eyes of Pallas are uniformly represented by
Homer as ofa reddish grey, by a term almost appro-
priated to herself, ψλαυκοςι a term which was pro-
bably typical of hei· internal radiation, as the
goddess of wisdom. The eye of the owl possesses
the same combinatiou ofcolours ; and hence, perhaps,
one reason for appropriating this bird to Minerva.
In Marchetti, we fiad casia translated “ sky-Irl11e,”
which makes nonsense of the original, unless we can
conceive that eyes of such a tine-ture were held in

universal abhorrence among the Romans:

 

Pallade somiglia
Chi gli occhi ha tiuti di color celeste.

*Lucretius has been copied in this passage by Ovid
Art. Am. ii. 659: though he is suspected to have
been himself in some degree indebted to Theocritus,
I. 25. who in his turn is accused of having borrowcd
from Plato, Polit. T. II. p. 474. ed. Stcpli. as tran-
„cribed hy Plutarch, V. II. p. 474.

The passage in Theocritus is as follows :

Βομῖνκα χαριεσσοι, Συραν καλεοντι τυ παντες
Ῑσχνοιν, oenomaus-ww· εγω δε μενος μελιχλωροι.

Και το ιον μελαν on.

Thee, Bombyx l thee a siren all affirm
Gracefu1‚ but sim-burn! :-—houey—h11ed the term
I give thy beauties—lovely in my eyes
As the pure black the violet that dyes-

In ovid, it occurs thus, as correctly amended by
Bentley:

Si straba sit, Veneri similis ; si rava Minervae
Sit gracilis, macie quae male viva sua est.
Dic habilem, quaecunque brevis 3 quae turgida.
plenam ι
Et lateat vitium proximitate boni.

Leers she, she's Venus 5—Pallas‚ if red-eyed ς
-ΟωεεῑιιΙ, if hectics waste her to a shade ;
1f small, alert ; if lai-ge, a portly bride :
Thus let some virtue every vice evade. .

Ver. 1214. The broad, bfig-bosom’d, Czazssull dis-
play'tl‚] Ceres, the divine object of the Ι
Eleusiniam mysteries, was always thus delineated, as
