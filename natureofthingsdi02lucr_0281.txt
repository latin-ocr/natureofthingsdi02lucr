3001< V. THE NATURE OF THINGS. 267

With all their records, conflagrations dire 3 55
Swept from the world, or earthquakes deep engulph'd,

Or floods, rapacious from perpetual rains,

Drown’d‚ and their towns, and citadels dissolv'd:

Then flows it doubly thou must own, convinc’d,

T hat heaven and earth hereafter may decay. 360
For since such woes, such dangers can assail

Created things, when once the cause augments

Perdition boundless must perforce ensue.

Nor by aught else can we ourselves decide

Mortal‚ but that with maladies we droop · 36 5

Like those whom NATURE ceaseless calls from life.

What lives immortal, too, must so exist

Or from its own solidity, empower’d

Each blow to conquer, undivided still,

As primal atoms, long anterior sung3 370

Or since, like vacuum, of all friction void,

Free from all touch, by impulse unimpair'd;

Or from the want of circling space in which

The severing atoms may dissolve and fall :

Such want the boundless whole of nature proves, 375
- And hence eterna13 for no place beyond

Spreads where its seeds could waste3 nor from without

Can foreign force e'er enter to destroy.
