DE RERUM NATURA.

Lm. VI.

Flammeus est plerumque colos, et splendidus, ollis.

Quippe et enim solis de lumine multa necesse est

Concipere, ut merito rubeant,

Hasce igitur quom ventus agens contrusit in unum

igneisque profundant.

210

Conpressitque locum, cogens; expressa profundunt

Semina, quae faciunt flammae fulgere colores.

Fulgit item, quom rarescunt quoque nubila coeli.

Nam, quom ventus eas leviter diducit cumeis,

Dissolvitque, cadant ingratiis illa necesse est

215

Semina, quae faciunt fulgorem: tum sine tetro

Terrore et sonitis fulgit, nulloque tumultu.

S pringi· the briqlvtstame, the splendid hues evinc'd.]
The rich and beautiful colours of the clouds are sup-
posed, by our poet, to result from their containing a
vast multitude of igneous atoms in a state of combina-
tion, and hence oflambent flame, discernible through
the nebulai· woof when perfectly dry. The conjec-
ture is ingeriiouS‚ but by no means satisfactory ; nor
is it positively det-idad, even in the present day, to
what cause this splendid appearance is to be attribu-
ted. And lii-st, as to the blneness of the sky itself.
This was long maintained by Leonardo di Vinci, and
his followers, to be produced on the principle, that
a black body, viewed through a thin white medium,
creates the sensation of blue; the immense depth of
the sky, it was contendcd, must necessarily bc black,
as being wholly devoid of reflected light; but this
blackness‚ it was added, being perceived by ourselves
through the common medium of the intermixed rays
of 1eflected light, which, in consequence of such in-
termnum-e, are rendered white, or at least whitish, it
must of course sosten into a general and homogcneous
azure. Newton, however, was not satisfied with this
explanation, and hence instituted a new hypothesis,

by which he endeavoured at once to account both for
the blneness of the sky, and the red and yellow tinc-
tures of the clouds. He asserted, that all vapoum,
as they ascend froin the earth, become, in the act of ⁷
condensing, first of such a texture as to reflect the
azure rays, before they coalesce into clouds capable of
reflecting any other; whence, on their first astent,
though an unclouded atmosphere, prior to their be-
coming objects of vision, they necessarily reflect one
unisorm blne : but as the condensation increases, they
unite into globules ofa great diversity of magnitudes,
till they at length acquire the size of drops of rain;
and, in consequence of such diversities, are capable of
refracffing, reflecting, and transmitting all that rich
and beautiful variety of colours to the general body
of these clouds, which are created by their union.
This explanation, however, has appeared as little
satisfactory to many philosophers‚ as the former hy-
pothesis of Leonardo di Vinci ς and it has been suc-
cessfully controverted by Bouguer and Melville. ,
“ ΧἫι)’,” says the latter, alluding to the unde'viating
crimson of the morning and evening sky, “should
the particles ofthe clouds become, at those particular
times, and never at any other, of such a magnitude ae
