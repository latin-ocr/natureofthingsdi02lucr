THE NATURE OF THINGS.

Abrupt the trembling couroers, rein’d afresh,

And into peace re-organiz’d the-world.
· So feign the bards of GREECE‚ devoid alike

Of truth, and reason.

Yet the power of fire

Doubtless might triumph, should the fiery seeds
Collect too largely from th' abyss of things:

When or some fiercer force their rage must quell‚

Or the red siroc burn the world to dust.

Thus, too, th’ insurgent waters once o’erpower'd‚

Humani generis cum solus constitit haeres
Deucalion, scopuloque orbem possedit in uno.
Necnon, cum patrias Pha'c'thon tentavit habenas,
Arserunt gentes. iv. 828.
Vast mountains sink—and now his wide command
Neptune extends, and scas o’erspread the land,
Contemning shores. Thus were the towns o’er-
flow'd,
When, the sole heir of man, Deucalion stood
On steep Parnassus, to repair the stock,
The spacious world poss-essing in one rock.
And when bold Pha‘e'ton, with idle force
The chariot fill'd, and drove the flaming horse ;
The earth took fire, heaven saw the stars recoil,
And frighted nature fear’d one common pile.

According to the tradition of the Greeks, the
world has therefore been twice menaeed with univcr-
sal ruin, once by fire, and once by water. This latter
suble is obviously derived from the sacred narrative of
Noah's flood ; a fact, as I have several times had oc-
casion to observc, corrobomtcd by every geologic rc-
search of modern times. But the Hebrcw scripturcs
make no mention of any equal catastrophe from the
operation of flrc ς and it is difficult to trace the fable
ol' the dai-ing Pha'c‘ton to any known erent in the an-
nals of the world: at the same time it should be meu-

tioned,that, upon a general minemlogical survey,there jcctilc power

seems little reason to doubt that some such event has

happened3 although its history is no longer recorded in
any existing archives. Such, indeed, are the proofs in
every climate of igneous fusion and vitrification, that,
as I have already remarked. Buffon, Dr. Hutt0n‚

Mr. Playfair‚ and various other geologist5‚ attribute
the origin of thc world itse1f‚ or at least its present
phaenomena, to the operation of this individual prin-
ciple. See Note on Book l. 69⁸3. The hypothesis of
Buffon supposes the former, and asserts, not only
that the earth, but that every other planet of the so-
lar system, was originally a comet3 and that these,
by striking at different times against the exter-nal
edge or limb of the solar- sphere, carried off some
portion of the sun’s igneous mass, which, by uniting
with the vapoury substance of the impinging· comet,
formed the chaotic basis of a future world. The
hypothesis of Dr. Hersehell, though built upon this
of Buffon, is far more sublime and extensive in its
range. It supposes the existence of an immense
mass of opake, but igucous matter, seated in the
that the suu. and every
