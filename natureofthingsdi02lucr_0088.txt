DE RERUM NATURA.

Illa tibi est igitur verborum copia cassa

Omnis, quae, contra sensus instructa, parata est.

Denique, ut in fabrica, si prava est regula prima, '

Normaque si fallax rectis regionibus exit,

Et libella aliqu& si ex parti claudicat hilum3

Omnia mendose fieri, atque obstipa, necessum est,

Pravo, cubantia, prona, supina, atque absona tecta3

Jam ruere ut quaedam videantur velle, ruantque

Prodita judiciis fallacibus omnia primis:

Sic igitur ratio tibiurerum prava, necesse est,

Falsaque sit, falsis quaequomque ab sensibus orta est.

Nunc aliei sensus, quo pacto quisque suam rem

Sentiat, haud quaquam ratio scruposa relicta est.

, Principio, auditur sonus, et vox omnis, in aureis

Ins—inuata suo pepulere ubi corpore sensum.

In the explanation of which, as well :s of every other
external sensation, the same common principles of
perception will be found to apply: and this, with
respect to the simplicity of the theory, must be ac-
knowledgcd an advantage which the Epicuream pos-
sessed over every other sect that was coe'val with it-
self. Upon the subject of vision, I have already ob-
sewed, that almost every ancient school differed from
that of Epicurus, and principally in conceiving, that
the sense of sight, instead of being iuduced by the
assault upon the retina of the mdiant effluence of the
body surveyed, was formed by the emission of a ra-

diant effluence from the retina itself, impinging upon
the object suweyed, and hereby creatinga knowledge
of its form, and other external qualities. Such was
tbe opinion of Plato, Aristotle, and the Stoics:> an
opinior. which, though long adhered to, and, indeed,
not relinquished till about a century and a half ago,
gained nothing, in point of information, beyond that
of Epicurus, and lost much in point of elegance and
simplicity. But the doctrine of effluence, or trans-
mission from an orgari of sense, was, by none of the
Grecian schools, applied to the solution of any other
faculty than that of sight: for, with respect to all
the rest, they seem to have coincided entirely in the
Epicurean dogma, and to have admitted, that each
was excited by the emanation of definite effluvia from
definite bodies acting upon the different organs by
a pcculiar and appropriate stimulus. Plato, indeed,
