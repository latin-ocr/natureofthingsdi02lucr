Could blend harmonicus, since too lIght with earth
To sink deprest‚ while yet too pond'rous far
To fly with ether towards the realms extreme:
So ’twixt the two they hover'd 3 vital there
Moving for ever, parts of the vast whole; 495
As move for ever in the frasne of man
Some active organs, while some oft repose.
These from the mass discharg'd‚ much next of earth
Subsided sudden, and the gulph disclos'd
Where ocean rolls his blue and briny tide. <00

Fill'd the wide. hollow of the liquid plains:
And ampler, too, th’ attenuate textures rush'd
Of air, and fise, and, borne οη swifter wing,

High rear'd the radiant temples of the sky.
