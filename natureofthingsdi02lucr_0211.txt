some kind of proportion to the number of parturi-
tione 3 woman had sustained, they successively deter-
mined that these vesicles must be inert egga, or
ovula, containing in extreme embryo a perfect minia-
ture of the form assumed afterwards, which, by the
pleasurable shock sustained throughout the whole
body in the immediate act of coition, but more di-
rectly by themselves from proximity of situation,
are instantaneously thrown into a state of vital acti-
vity, are detachcd from the common clustcr of which
they constitute a part, and in a short time pass into
the uterus, through the canal of the Fallopian tube,
which spontaneously enlarges sor the purpose ς where,
by the genial power of the uterus itself, the incipient
embryon is gradually evolved and angmentcd into 3
perfect fetus, and partakes of the common form and
properties of the parent stock. The little animal, it
was maintained by Harvey, might be occasionally
impressed with an organie resemblance to the father,
from the electi-ic impulsion communicated in copula·
tion to every portion of the flnids and solids ofthe
body, and of consequence to the essential humour ot*
the ova themselves: bnt, reasoning from the length
of the vaana in cows, and many other animals, and

his own occasional dissections of the human subject*

shortly after coition, he contendcd that the emitted
flnid of the malt· never could emer the uterus, and of
course could not mechanically assist in the evolution
os the contained embryon.

Leewenhoek and Hartsocher, however, upon a
more accurate anatomy of the uterus immediately af-
ter copulation, discovered, not only that the projected
male flnid could enter into its cavity‚ but that it ac—
tnally did thus enter, 3ηά in some instant-es. which fell
bentath their notice, had obviously ascendcd into the
1³anop³an tuhcfl. And now 3 new doctrine was
started, and one altogether opposite to the theory of
Han-cy. Upon the principle of the former, the father
lnid no immediate connexion with his own child ς hc
could not beztow npon it a particle of his curporeal
frume. and the entire producti->n was the operation of
the mother. ln conszqnence then, of this discovery,

we wcre instructcd, that the whole creation was the
property of the father, and that the mother, in her
turn, had nothing to do with it ς that every particle
of the projected fluid was a true and perfect semen,
containing in itsclf, like the ovum of the female
upon the theory of Harvey, the miniature of all th:-
organs and innuba-rs os the future fctus, which in dnc
time were gradually evolved and augmented ; and
that the uterus and ovum, into which some one of
these semina wa< alu-:ost sure of being protruded in
the act of coition, conjointly offered nothing more
than a mere nest, in which the homunculus, or rudi-
mental fctus, was deposited for warmth and nutriment.
And as the former theory appealed to the phaencmcna
of oviparous animals during the period of incubation,
the phaenomena of worms and porwigles were appealed
to *by the latter: and 3 very considerable degree of lise
and motion were supposed to be incontrovertibly dis-
covered by the aid of good magnifying glasscs in the
seminal fluid itself, 3ηά not less than many milliens
of these homunculi, or little unborn men, frisking
about in the diameter of the smallest grain of sarid,
and all of them of the exact shape of a taclpole. But
Dehxppius, a pnpil os Lcewenhoek, advanced sai-ther ς
for he not only saw these tadpolee, but traced one of
thern bursting through its tunic, and exhibitur: two
arms, two legs, the human head and beart. >
